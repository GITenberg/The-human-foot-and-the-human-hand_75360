<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HUMAN_FOOT">THE HUMAN FOOT.</h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">THE Human Body is one of the most worthy
objects of man’s study. It is the noblest as
well as the crowning work of creation. In it
material organization is carried to the greatest
perfection. It surpasses, therefore, all other physical
objects in exquisiteness of construction and
in interest. How comes it, then, that most persons
are so ignorant respecting it? Men, well
informed in other matters, are usually altogether
uninformed with regard to this. In every other
branch of science we find amateur students pursuing
the subject with zeal and success. Geology,
Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, and even Comparative
Anatomy have each their votaries; but
Human Anatomy attracts no one. Why is this?
Partly, I think, because opportunities for acquiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
such information as is suitable and interesting
are not so many as they ought to be.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, also, that we teachers of
Anatomy are somewhat to blame. We are too
prone, in our Lectures and Examinations, to dwell
upon bare details, without enlivening those details
with the many bright features of interest with
which they are naturally invested; and we fail,
therefore, to render it so attractive a science as it
might be. The example of those able and animated
teachers, John and Charles Bell, who laboured
with some success to disperse the clouds that
have ever overhung the horizon of anatomy, has
been too much forgotten; and the flame which
they kindled has almost died out under the chilling
apathy of their successors. Truly glad should
I be to see a change in this. I cannot but think
that if the teachers of Anatomy took higher
and more philosophical views of their science
there would be no lack of interest on the part
of the students. The interest so excited would
soon spread beyond the limits of the profession;
and there would thus be opened up to the public
some of the products of that rich vein of knowledge
and of that abundant material for thought
which lie buried in the human frame.</p>

<p>I therefore willingly accede to your request for
a Lecture upon some part of the anatomy of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
human body, relying upon the intrinsic interest of
the subject to make amends for my own deficiencies
in expounding it; and I select the <span class="smcap">Human Foot</span>,
because a few of the more important points of its
construction can be explained without much difficulty,
because it affords a good illustration of
some of the principles of animal mechanism, and
because its form constitutes one of the great
characteristics whereby man is distinguished from
the lower animals. As an instrument of support
and of locomotion it excels the foot of any other
animal. It evinces its excellence by enabling
man to stand upright in a way that no other
animal can do; and so efficiently does the foot
accomplish this and perform the task of carrying
the body, that the hand is set at liberty to
minister to the will. Thus is the foot instrumental
in giving us an advantage over other animals,
and in enabling us to provide the means of defence;
and, thus, it aids us to carry out those
wondrous works which are second only to the
marvellous results of creative power.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to regard the hand as the
great agent by which all this is attained, and
we are apt to forget how much it is indebted
to the foot. We do not reflect that, if the foot
of man presented no distinguishing peculiarity,
the hand, like the corresponding part in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
animals, would be compelled to share with it
the task of carrying the body, and could, therefore,
not be devoted to the various offices which
it is now free to perform. Little right has the
hand to say to the foot, “I have no need of thee.”</p>


<h3><i>The principle of “division of labour.”</i></h3>

<p>In this concentration of locomotive power in
the foot we have an illustration of what is called
the “principle of division of labour,” a principle
with which all civilized communities are familiar,
and to which we are much indebted for the present
advanced state of the arts and sciences; but
which we may be said to have borrowed from the
economy of nature. We find ever-increasing manifestations
of it as we ascend in the animal series,
from the lower and more simple to the higher and
more complicated forms. Indeed, just as each step
in civilization is attended with a further development
of this principle, so is each division of the
animal kingdom distinguished from those below
it by the more distinct assignation of particular
functions to particular organs, and by the consequent
improvement of the mode in which the
functions are performed. While, in proportion as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the several organs acquire more distinct speciality
in their work, so do they become, more and more,
dependent upon one another, and, more and
more, subjected to the control of central government,
which is represented by the brain.</p>

<p>For instance, some of the lower animals, as
the fresh-water <span class="smcap">Polyp</span>, present nearly a uniform
structure throughout their whole substance; and
every part of them consequently performs the same
function. There is not one organ for digestion,
another for circulation, a third for respiration, and
so on; but all these functions are performed by
the same structure, and are performed, therefore,
in a rude and imperfect manner. Any portion
of the creature possesses all the requisites for its
own nutrition, and is, so, independent of the remainder,
and can live alone. Hence, the polyp
may be divided into a number of pieces, each
of which goes on living. Gradually, as we ascend
from these lowly beings to the higher classes of
animals, we find organs and functions more and
more distinct from another; a Stomach is provided
for the work of digestion, a Heart for circulation,
Lungs for respiration. Each of these
organs is essential to the existence of the others
and of every part of the body; and they are
all maintained in harmonious co-operation by
the presiding influence of the nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Or, trace one of the <i>functions</i> in illustration
of the same principle. Take the function of Locomotion,
which has an especial relation to our
present subject. In the <span class="smcap">Leech</span> and the <span class="smcap">Worm</span>
the whole length of the body is occupied in the
work, one part as much as another; and still, it
is but a crawl. In the <span class="smcap">Fish</span> the whole body
is buoyed up by the water; it is flattened from
side to side, and is all, from the head to the
tail, concerned in the lateral stroke by which the
animal is driven along; the side fins, which are
the representatives of limbs, doing little beyond
serving to guide and balance. In the other <span class="smcap">Vertebrates</span>
the work of locomotion is so far concentrated
as to be assigned, almost entirely, to
the limbs. All <i>four</i> limbs are in most of them
devoted to it; while the bones and muscles of
the trunk are only indirectly concerned in it.
In <span class="smcap">Man</span>, however, <i>two</i> limbs only are assigned
to this important office. In him, therefore, the
concentration of locomotive power, in other words
the principle of division of labour, is carried out
to the greatest extent—a disposition which affords
one of the many proofs that the construction of
his body combines with the faculties of his
mind to place him at the head of the animal
kingdom.</p>

<p>In making comparisons of different animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
with one another, and in speaking of the relative
perfection of their several organs, we must
not forget that <i>every</i> organ of every animal is
perfect as regards the purpose for which it was
made. But some animals are said to occupy a
higher position than others, or to be superior to
others, because their mechanism is more complex,
and they are, thereby, enabled to perform
a greater variety of functions. And, in the animal
kingdom, in proportion as each function rises
into prominence, and becomes well and distinctly
performed, so is a special organ assigned to it,
and that organ becomes more and more highly
elaborated.</p>

<p>You will not misunderstand me, then, when
I say that concentration of function and perfection
of structure usually go together. And, forasmuch
as in the lower limbs of man there is a
greater concentration of locomotive function than
in any other part of any other animal, you will
expect to find, in them, a greater perfection of
locomotive mechanism—that is to say, a more
complete combination of strength with variety,
rapidity, and extent of movement—than is elsewhere
to be met with.</p>

<p>This consideration will ensure attention while
I give a brief account of the anatomy of man’s
lower limb, more particularly of the foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>


<h3><i>Structure of the Lower Limbs.</i></h3>

<p>The weight of the trunk is transmitted to the
knee (see fig. <a href="#f04">4</a>, p. 15) by a single bone—the thigh-bone.
This is the longest bone in the body, measuring,
on the average, nearly eighteen inches.
Above, it is jointed with the haunch-bone of the
pelvis at the hip-joint. From the knee two bones
descend to the ankle. Of these one is much the
larger, and bears the chief of the weight. The
other serves to give attachment to muscles, and to
strengthen the ankle-joint. It runs down on the
outer side of the ankle, forming there what is
called the “outer ankle;” and a process of the
larger bone runs down, in like manner, on the
inner side, and forms the “inner ankle.” The
front and inner side of the larger bone are close
under the skin. This part is called the “<i>shin</i>,”
being so named perhaps from the word “chine”
or edge, because the leg presents an edge along
the front, to facilitate its cleaving a way through
the air, water, grass, or underwood. The shin
itself is not particularly tender; but the skin is a
good deal exposed here, and, as it lies so near the
hard bone, it is easily injured; and, when “broken,”
it is often difficult to heal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>In some very tall persons, and particularly in
those who are so tall as to be called <span class="smcap">Giants</span>, I
have found the leg or shank bones, that is, the
bones between the knee and the ankle, very long,
disproportionately long to the rest of the skeleton.
They are so in the skeleton of the Irish Giant,
O’Byrne, which is preserved in the Museum of the
College of Surgeons, in another Irish Giant in the
Museum of Trinity College, Dublin, and in some
other specimens which I have had an opportunity
of measuring. In the name “Long Shanks” given
to Edward I., the word “shanks” probably included
the thigh as well as the leg, just as we are in the
habit of applying the word “leg” to the whole of
the lower limb.</p>


<h3><i>Bones of the Foot.</i></h3>

<figure class="figright illowp100" id="f01" style="max-width: 16.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f01.jpg" alt="Bones of the foot">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_01">1</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are 26 bones in the Foot. The hinder
7—called <i>tarsal</i> bones—are short and thick; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
form the hinder part of the instep. In front of
them lie 5 <i>metatarsal</i> bones, one passing, forwards,
from the fore part of the tarsus to each toe. Behind,
these are close together, and are connected
with the tarsus. As they run forwards they diverge
a little from one another; and their anterior
ends rest upon the ground, and form the “balls”
of the toes. They constitute the fore part of the
instep. The remaining 14 bones are the toes.
They are arranged in rows, like soldiers in a phalanx,
three deep, and are hence called <i>phalanges</i>.</p>

<p>You observe that, although each of the other
toes has 3 bones, the great toe has only 2. In this
respect, therefore, it is an imperfect, or, rather, an
incomplete member. The deficiency does not depend
upon a want of length in the great toe; for
this is usually as long as the second toe; in some
persons it is a good deal longer; and it is always
distinctly longer than the outer two toes. The
reason for there being only two phalanges instead
of three probably is because the great toe is required
to be stronger than any of the others; and
an additional bone would have tended to weaken
it. I have, elsewhere‍<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>, given reasons for thinking
that it is the middle phalanx which is absent in
the great toe.</p>

</div>

<p>It is a curious and interesting fact, affording a
remarkable illustration of the close adherence to a
uniform plan which has been observed in the construction
of the various animals, that, in no instance,
does this toe contain more than two bones.
Even in those creatures, as the <span class="smcap">Seal</span> (fig. 2), in which
it attains to greater length than any of the other
sprawling digits, it contains the same number of
bones as in man, its extraordinary length being
attained by an elongation of the two bones, not by
the addition of a third. And in those animals, as
certain Lizards (fig. 3), where the number of bones
in the other toes is increased to 4 or even 5, the
number in the first, or inner, toe is still no more
than two. The same rule applies to the fore limb;
the number of bones in the inner digit, which, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
man and monkeys, is called the “thumb,” is in no
case more than two. In some animals, as will be
mentioned again, there is only one bone in this
digit, and in some the digit is wanting altogether;
but in none does it contain <i>more</i> than <i>two</i> bones.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a still more remarkable instance
of adherence to a particular number of bones.
In the mammalian group of animals the <i>neck</i>, with
only one or two exceptions, contains <i>seven</i> bones,
neither more nor less. Whether it be the long
neck of the <span class="smcap">Giraffe</span>, or the short neck of the
<span class="smcap">Mouse</span>, the <span class="smcap">Bat</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Porpoise</span>, each consists,
like the neck in <span class="smcap">Man</span>, of seven bones. For what
reason a particular number should be thus rigidly
observed, it is not easy to say.</p>

<p>Of the seven tarsal bones the uppermost (fig. <a href="#f01">1</a>)
is called the <i>astragalus</i>, from a supposed resemblance
to a die. It is the middle bone of the
instep. Above, it is jointed with the leg-bones;
behind, it is connected with, and rests upon, the
<i>heel-bone</i>, which is the largest bone in the foot.
The bone which lies immediately in front of the
astragalus, and supports it in this direction, is
called the <i>scaphoid</i>, or boat-like, bone. In front of
it are three <i>wedge-bones</i>, each of which is connected
with one of the metatarsal bones of the inner
three toes. On the outer side of the wedge-bones,
connected with the metatarsals of the two small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
toes, and locked in between them and the heel-bone,
is the <i>cuboid</i> bone.</p>

<p>I must confine my remarks chiefly to the <i>human</i>
foot. Still the anatomy of man derives so
much interest from being studied in connexion
with that of the lower animals, and is so much
more instructive when this is done, that I cannot
forbear diverging, here and there, to make a few
comparisons. Let me, for a moment, draw your
attention to a similarity, in general construction,
which exists between the lower limbs of man, and
the hinder limbs of other animals. And the comparison
may be extended to the fore limbs; for
however diverse may be the appearance and the
mode of action of the limbs in different animals,
whether they be terminated by hands or by feet,
whether they move upon the ground or ply in air
or water, whether they be attached to the head,
as are the front fins in many fishes, or, as is more
common, be situated at the fore and hinder parts
of the trunk, the same plan is traceable in all.</p>

<p>Great, indeed, is the variety of detail in nature.
It is everywhere observable. No two things,
however near their resemblance, are precisely
alike. Yet, as I have before said, there is a remarkable
adherence to unity of plan. One star
differs from another star in glory, yet all appear
fashioned in the same manner, and subject to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
same laws. There are almost infinite varieties in
the vertebrate kingdom. Each animal exhibits
its own peculiarities; yet they are all formed
in the same manner, and are developed upon
one fundamental pattern, diverging from it in
different ways according to the requirements of
each. Again, though the several parts of the same
animal differ from one another; yet in the skeleton
the same bones which exist in one part may,
as a general rule, be traced in other parts and in
other animals. The bones which make up the pelvis
in man are repeated in his shoulder, and, even,
in his skull; and they may be recognised in the
pelvis, in the shoulder, and in the skull, of all other
vertebrate animals, with few exceptions. They undergo,
it is true, great varieties in shape and size;
but they can be shown to be the same, or, in the
language of anatomists, to be “homologous.” It
is highly interesting to the anatomist to trace
the same bone through the different parts of the
same animal, and through the various animals of
the vertebrate series, and to observe the modifications
which it undergoes in order to adapt it to
the multiform mechanism of the several classes,
to observe it sometimes dwindling, or even vanishing,
and then, it may be, reappearing under some
new conditions.</p>

<p>I must, however, resist the temptation to wander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
into this attractive field. It will suffice to
take an illustration by a comparison of the bones
of the human lower limb with those of the hind
limb of the Horse. This may be easily done by
the aid of these drawings (figs. 4> and 5) in which
the two limbs are placed side by side, and the corresponding
bones are marked with the same letters.
Notwithstanding the many points of difference
the same plan will be recognised in each.
There is in each the thigh(<span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>), the leg(<span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>), and the
foot, with the tarsal and metatarsal(<span class="lowercase smcap">G</span>) bones, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
the phalanges(<span class="lowercase smcap">H</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">I</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">K</span>). But in the <span class="smcap">Horse</span> two of
the digits (the marginal ones, that is, the great toe
and the little toe) are wanting, two are rudimentary,
and the remaining one, which corresponds with
the middle toe of man, in length, size, and strength,
more than makes amends for the deficiency of the
others. The lowermost bone, or terminal phalanx,
of this huge toe, called the <i>coffin-bone</i>(<span class="lowercase smcap">K</span>), is encased
in the hoof, which corresponds with the
human nail, and is the only part of the foot that
rests upon the ground.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Man</span> the whole weight of the body has to
be borne upon <i>two</i> feet; often it is balanced upon
<i>one</i>. The foot is, consequently, spread out; and
all the bones, from the heel to the tips of the
toes, are made to form the basis of support upon
the ground. The <span class="smcap">Horse</span>, on the contrary, having
no hands, but <i>four</i> feet, does not require so great
breadth in each foot; and the opportunity is
taken to narrow the foot, and to lengthen it
so as to give fleetness. The end is attained by
suppressing some of the toes, by elongating
one far beyond the others, and enduing it with
such strength as to enable it to carry the requisite
weight upon the tip of the last phalanx.
The heel(<span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>) is raised high above the ground and
becomes the “hock.” To speak of a horse <i>kicking
with his heels</i> is, therefore, about as correct as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
say, that he <i>breaks his knees</i>. His knee, as you
perceive by the position of the “knee-cap”(<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>), is
high up in the hind limb, near his body, quite
out of harm’s way in a fall. The fact is, that he
kicks with his <i>toes</i>; and, when he falls, he cuts the
skin over the part in his <i>fore</i> limbs, which corresponds
with the back of our <i>wrists</i>.</p>

<p>In the upper segment, or thigh, the difference
between the two limbs is seen to be, to a certain
extent, the reverse of what it is below. That is
to say, whereas, in the <span class="smcap">Horse</span>, the <i>toe</i> is elongated
and thickened, so as greatly to exceed the corresponding
part of the human limb; in <span class="smcap">Man</span> the
<i>thigh-bone</i> is elongated, so as to be double the
length of that of the horse; the thigh-bone in man
is also placed more vertically, nearly in the plane
of gravity of the trunk. The horse’s thigh-bone
slants forwards and outwards, which gives the muscles
great power by causing them to run more at
right angles between their points of attachment;
and this arrangement increases the strength of the
animal in drawing weights, and facilitates springing.
A man cannot spring without first bending
the limbs a little; whereas a horse, or a goat, can
spring, at once, from the position in which it is
standing.</p>

<h3><i>The Arch of the Foot.</i></h3>

<p>The seven tarsal and the five metatarsal bones—that
is, the twelve bones of the instep—are arranged
and jointed together so as to form an arch
from the point of the heel to the balls of the toes.
This is called the “plantar arch,” from the Latin
word <i>planta</i>, the sole of the foot. The <i>astragalus</i>
forms the summit, or key-bone, of the arch. It
receives the weight from the leg, and transmits it,
through the hinder pillar of the arch, to the heel,
and, through the front pillar of the arch, to the
balls of the toes.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="f06" style="max-width: 23.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f06.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_06">6</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The drawing represents a section, from behind
forwards, of the lower end of the leg-bone, and of
the bones lying along the inner side of the plantar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
arch. Behind it extends through the heel-bone,
and in front through the great toe. It exhibits
the arrangement of the fibres and plates in the
interior of the bones, and shows that the greater
number of them, in each bone, follow the direction
of the two pillars of the arch; that is to say, they
descend from the summit of the arch where it
supports the leg-bone, backwards and downwards,
to the heel, and, forwards and downwards, to the
balls of the toes. Their arrangement is, therefore,
such as to give resisting strength to the bones in
the directions in which it is most required.</p>

<p>You may think that the arch of the foot would
have been a much simpler structure, as well as
stronger, if it had been composed of one bone instead
of several. But it must be remembered that
it would, then, have been liable to be cracked and
broken by the sudden and violent manner in which,
during running and jumping, the weight of the
body is thrown upon it. Moreover, the several
bones, where they touch one another, are covered
with a tolerably thick layer of highly elastic gristle
or cartilage (represented by the clear line left in
the drawing along the contiguous edges of the
bones); and this provision, together with the slight
movements which take place between these bones,
gives an elasticity to the foot and to the step, and
serves to break the jars and shocks which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
caused by the sudden contact of the foot with the
ground.</p>

<p>This last is a very important point; and we find
numerous contrivances in different parts of the
body to protect the brain and other delicate organs
from jars. So efficient are these contrivances,
and so exact is the adaptation of the mechanism
of the limbs and the trunk to the texture of the
internal organs, that, while these are in a healthy
state, we are able to run, to jump, and to leap
from a considerable height, without inconvenience.
But, if the organs be inflamed, or if the nervous
system be over sensitive, as in common headache,
the provisions, which are calculated for the normal
state, are insufficient; ordinary movements are
then painful, and to jump is intolerable.</p>

<p>The muscles play a very essential part in this
work. <i>First</i>, they place the limbs in the most favourable
position. Thus, when we alight upon the
ground, from a height, we always contrive to do so
with the knees and hips a little bent, so that the
limbs readily yield at the joints, and act as springs
to break the jar. Elderly persons commonly keep
the limbs bent, even when walking quietly along.
They do this because they need all the benefit which
position will afford to make amends for the loss of
elasticity consequent on the thinning and drying
of the cartilages, and other changes that take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
in the body with advancing years. <i>Secondly</i>, the
muscles brace the limbs and joints in the position
in which they have placed them. We experience
the effect of the want of this salutary influence
when we kick against an unseen object, or fall
suddenly, or receive any blow or shock for which
we are unprepared. How disagreeable, to say the
least, it is to make the step for an additional stair
when we have arrived at the top of a staircase, or,
still worse, to meet with an unseen stair when we
think that we have got to the bottom.</p>

<p>You perceive from the drawing (fig. <a href="#f06">6</a>) that
there is a great difference between the two pillars
of the plantar arch. The hinder pillar is comparatively
short, and narrow, and descends suddenly,
almost in a vertical direction, from the ankle, to
the ground; and it is composed of only one bone—the
heel-bone—which is jointed directly with the
astragalus: whereas the fore pillar is longer and
broader, is composed of several bones jointed together,
and slopes much more gradually to the
ground. There is, therefore, far less elasticity in
the hinder part of the foot than in the fore part.
Hence, when we descend from a height upon the
ground, we always alight upon the balls of the
toes, and thus gain the advantage which the several
bones and joints afford in breaking the shock.
If, after going up stairs this evening, you take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
trouble to come down again, you will find that
you alight upon each stair on the balls of the toes
and experience no inconvenience, however quickly
the descent is made. But, if you change the mode
of proceeding, and descend upon the heels, the
feeling will be by no means agreeable; and the
various organs of the body, being disturbed from
their accustomed repose, will raise such remonstrances
against your infringement upon nature’s
ways, that you will scarcely be able to continue
the experiment. Proportionately more distressing
is the sensation caused by jumping from a chair
upon the heels. Indeed, this is not done altogether
without risk; and the trial of it is scarcely to be
recommended to persons who have attained to that
sober period of life at which we are willing to concede
that, in some things, nature is wiser than
ourselves. Only a short time since I saw a gentleman,
who, in jumping down some steps into a
back yard, accidentally came upon his heels, and
jarred one hip so severely that he was confined to
his sofa for several days in consequence.</p>

<p>But, you may say, “in walking we do place the
heel upon the ground first and experience no inconvenience.”
True, because the force with which
the foot descends in walking is very slight; and
the weight is directed upon the heel, obliquely, in
such a manner as to bring the toes very quickly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the ground, and really to throw nearly the whole
force in that direction. Moreover, you may observe
that when we walk, the weight of the body
is partly sustained by the fore part of the one foot
till the whole of the other foot is on the ground.
I will, however, revert to the disposition of the
feet in walking and running presently.</p>

<p>The arch of the foot has to bear great weight
and at great disadvantage; and there is very
little in the <i>shape</i> of the bones to maintain its
integrity. Indeed, they all fall asunder when the
other structures are removed, the key-bone dropping
through of its own weight. And the same
thing may be remarked throughout the skeleton.
Wherever two or more bones move upon one
another, their surfaces are so constructed that
they do not hold together without some assistance
from the soft parts. There are joints in the
body which we call “hinge-joints,” and others
which we call “ball-and-socket joints;” but in
none of them is there such a holding and locking
of one part in the other as you have in the
hinge and the ball-and-socket of the mechanic.
In every case the bones are held together, not by
their own shape, but by ligaments and muscles.
Consequently, any one of the bones may be dislocated
from those next it without breakage;
and when the muscles and ligaments are cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
through, or have been destroyed by maceration,
all the bones, between which any movement was
possible during life, separate from one another.</p>

<p>Not only is this so, but in no instance are
the movements of joints <i>limited</i> simply by the
shape of the bones—that is to say, they are never
brought to a stop by a part of one bone coming
into contact with the edge of another. Such a
contact would have caused a <i>sudden</i> check; and
this would have been attended with more or less
jar and with some danger of chipping and breaking
the articular edges. The range of movement
of a joint is always regulated by the ligaments
or the muscles, not, directly, by the bones; and
the restraint thus imposed upon the movements
is brought to bear, not suddenly, but <i>gradually</i>;
somewhat like the effect of the “break” upon a
railway-train; while the cartilages between the
bones may be compared with the “buffers” between
the carriages.</p>

<p>It is chiefly by means of strong <span class="smcap">Ligaments</span>,
or sinewy bands, passing from bone to bone, that
the shape of the plantar arch is maintained and
the movements of the bones upon one another
are regulated and limited. These ligaments are
numerous; but I will mention only two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="f07" style="max-width: 23.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f07.jpg" alt="Side view of foot bones and main ligaments">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_07">7</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One, the <i>Plantar Ligament</i> (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>, fig. 7), of
great strength, passes from the under surface of
the heel-bone, near its extremity, forwards, to the
ends of the metatarsal bones; in other words, it
extends between the lowest points of the two
pillars of the arch, girding, or holding, them in
their places, and preventing their being thrust
asunder when pressure is made upon the key-bone
(<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>); just as the “tie-beam” of a roof resists
the tendency to outward yielding of the sides
when weight is laid upon the summit. The ligament,
however, has an advantage which no tie-beam
can ever possess; inasmuch as a quantity
of muscular fibres are attached along the hinder
part of its upper surface. These instantly respond
to any demand that is made upon them, being
thrown into contraction directly the foot touches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the ground; and the force of their contraction
is proportionate to the degree of pressure which
is made upon the foot. Thus they add a living,
self-acting, self-regulating power to the passive
resistance of the ligament. In addition to its
office of binding the bones in their places, the
ligament serves the further purpose of protecting
from pressure the tender structures—the blood-vessels,
nerves and muscles—that lie above it, in
the hollow of the foot, under the shelter of the
plantar arch.</p>

<p>Another very strong ligament (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span> in the wood-cut)
passes from the under and fore part of the
heel-bone (<span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>) to the under part of the scaphoid
bone (<span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>). It underlies and supports the round head
of the astragalus, and has to bear a great deal of
the weight which is transmitted to that bone from
the leg. It does not derive the same assistance
from a close connexion with muscular fibres as
the ligament just described; but it possesses a
quality, which that and most other ligaments do
not have, viz. elasticity. This is very important, for
it allows the head of the key-bone (<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>) to descend
a little, when pressure is made upon it, and forces
it up again when the pressure is removed, and
so gives very material assistance to the other
provisions for preventing jars and for giving ease
and elasticity to the step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>A glance at the drawing will show you that
here is a weak point in the foot. The head of
the key-bone receives great weight from the leg,
but is comparatively unsupported; and there is
a considerable strain upon this part when the heel
is being raised in walking. Moreover, a good deal
of movement takes place between the key-bone
(<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>) and the scaphoid bone (<span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>), more than between
any other two bones of the instep; and freedom
in the range of movement is generally attended
with some sacrifice of strength. The strong elastic
ligament comes in therefore with peculiar advantage
at this point; and it is underlaid, and additional
support is afforded exactly when it is
most required, by the tendon (b in fig. <a href="#f12">12</a>) of a
strong muscle, the especial office of which is to
assist in raising the heel and bending the instep,
and which runs, from the back of the leg, behind
the inner ankle, to the scaphoid bone.</p>


<h3><i>Weak Ankle and Flat-foot.</i></h3>

<p>In spite, however, of the thick elastic ligament
and the strong tendon just mentioned, the
joint between the astragalus or key-bone and the
scaphoid bone still remains a weak point. The
head of the key-bone, from being insufficiently
supported or from being overweighted, is very apt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
to descend a little below its proper level; the consequence
of which is that the plantar arch is lowered
and the foot is flattened; and the more the foot
is flattened the weaker it necessarily is, because
the position of the bones then becomes less and
less favourable for bearing weight, and an increasing
strain is thus incurred by the ligaments and
muscles. Hence the foot and ankle feel weak;
and the weakness is especially felt when the person
endeavours to raise the heel, so as to mount
upon the balls of the toes, in walking. For the
performance of that movement with ease and
steadiness a well-formed plantar arch is essential;
and the person, whose feet are defective in the
manner we are considering, can never walk with
a bold, firm step. The movement in him may be
better described as a shuffling from one foot on to
the other, than as a walk. To this I will recur
again when I come to speak more of walking. The
defect, when slight in degree, is commonly called
“weak-ankle;” when more decided it is called
“flat-foot,” because the sole is then nearly, or
quite, flat. The head of the key-bone, under
such circumstances, may even bulge downwards
and inwards, and form a prominence on the inner
side of the sole, so as to give more or less <i>convexity</i>
to the line on the inner side of the foot,
which should be <i>concave</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp38" id="f08" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f08.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_08">8</a>. Flat-foot.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The representation of “flat-foot” here shown
was drawn from the foot of a labouring man in
this county. He said he believed the deformity
was due to his having worn thick tight shoes
when he was a growing boy. He is most likely
right in his opinion; for tight or ill-fitting shoes,
cramping the feet and preventing the proper
growth of the bones and the free play of the
muscles, are a common cause of this evil. This
is so especially among the agricultural class, whose
feet are, from an early period, enclosed in stiff
unyielding leather cases that are enough to mar
nature’s best efforts to construct a plantar arch.</p>

<p>The same drawing shows that flat-foot is not
the only deformity for which “high-lows” are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
answerable. Besides the almost total want of
calf, which is due to the wearer being obliged to
hobble along, whole-footed, with short feeble steps,
it will be seen that the great toe has not been
allowed to assume its natural straight line, but
has been squeezed athwart the other toes, so as
to be almost at a right angle with the foot.
No room at all is thus given for the second toe;
it has been driven quite out of the field, and
has been obliged to hide itself by bending down
under the other toes. This is no uncommon
state of things. Frequently it is attended with
the formation of a painful bunion upon the prominent
inner side of the ball of the great toe;
and, in addition, there is sometimes a corn upon
the first joint of the second toe, which is a source
of so much inconvenience that I have known
many sufferers glad to get relief by parting with
the toe.</p>

<p>I wish I could hope that the days of high-lows
are numbered, and could believe that in
the next generation they will be ranged with
the things of the past, and that our children
may know these enemies to the form of the rustic
foot, only as objects to be gazed upon with feelings
of astonishment and pity, just as we regard
the perukes and the stays of our ancestors.
There are, however, some practical difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
in the way of the fulfilment of this charitable
wish.</p>

<p>There are two periods of life at which <span class="smcap">Flat-foot</span>
is most likely to be engendered. <i>First</i>, in
infancy, if the child be put upon its feet too
early, before the bones and ligaments are strong
enough to bear the weight of the body. Therefore
mothers should not indulge their anxiety to
see their infants walk very early; the pride attendant
on premature success is liable to be followed
by regret at finding that the children never
walk well. Parents and nurses should be content
to let the children crawl and roll about upon
the floor, and should not encourage them to
stand upright, especially if they be rather heavy
or weak children. Children are quite sure to
acquire the faculty of walking as soon as they are
well fit to exercise it.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> period is at about fourteen. The
body attains a considerable increase of weight
at this time, in consequence of the quick growth
that takes place. We often remark that lads and
girls of this age shoot up apace; and their greater
weight is not always attended with a proportionate
acquisition of strength. They are apt to
be rather weak and ungainly in their movements;
and the weakness often shows itself in the foot,
by a yielding of the plantar arch. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
many boys and girls are, at this age, turned out
into the world to earn a livelihood, and are
obliged to be a good deal upon their feet, and
perhaps, in addition, have to carry weights.
Thus errand-boys, butchers’ and bakers’ boys, and
young nursery-maids, are frequent sufferers in
this way. The constrained positions in dancing,
also, if enforced too much, or continued too long,
so as to tire the feet, sometimes lead to the
same result. On the other hand, moderate exercise
of this kind is calculated to strengthen the
foot and also the whole frame, and contributes
much to improve the carriage.</p>

<p>This is not the place to enter into particulars
of <i>treatment</i>. I will, therefore, merely remark
that the common notion of supporting and
strengthening the ankles by tight-laced boots is
altogether a mistake, and must be ranked among
the most influential of the causes which combine
to spoil so many feet. It has its parallel in the
idea of strengthening the waist by stays. The notion
is, in both instances, fortified by the fact that
those persons who have been accustomed to the
pressure, either upon the ankle or the waist,
feel a want of it when it is removed, and are
uncomfortable without it. They forget, or are
unconscious, that the feeling of the want has
been engendered by the appliance, and that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
they never resorted to the latter they would
never have experienced the former; just as dram-drinking
induces a recurrence to the stimulus by
causing a sense of sinking when it is discontinued;
and, for the same reason, the opium-eater
can hardly exist without his drug.</p>


<h3><i>The Movements of the Foot.</i></h3>

<p>We come now to the <span class="smcap">Movements</span> of the foot
upon the leg; and rarely do we contemplate anything
more calculated to excite our admiration.
Consider their variety, the rapidity with which
they take place, in order to effect the requisite
succession of positions in walking and running,
and to adapt the sole to the inequalities of the
surface on which we tread; and remember the
great weight which has to be sustained while
these movements are going on: yet, how seldom
is there a failure.</p>

<p>This combination of variety of movement with
security is effected by the employment of <i>three</i>
joints, each of which plays in a direction different
from the others, while all act harmoniously
together.</p>

<p><i>One</i> of the three joints—strictly called the
“ankle-joint”—is between the leg-bones and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
foot-bones, that is, between the tibia and fibula,
above, and the astragalus beneath. By means of
it the foot may be bent or straightened upon
the leg; in other words, the toes may be raised
or depressed. In this movement the heel participates,
being depressed when the toes are raised,
and <i>vice versâ</i>. A <i>second</i> joint is between the
astragalus and the heel-bone. It permits the
foot to be rolled inwards or outwards upon an
antero-posterior axis; so that the sole may be
turned inwards, with its inner edge upwards, or
may be turned down so as to be placed flat
upon the ground. A <i>third</i> joint is between the
first and second row of tarsal bones—that is, between
the astragalus and the heel bone, behind,
and the scaphoid and cuboid bones in front. It
permits the degree of flexure of the tarsal or
plantar arch to be increased or diminished.</p>

<p>Had the several movements which are requisite
for easy walking all taken place in one joint,
that joint must necessarily have been very insecure;
indeed, it must have been a “ball-and-socket”
joint, and we should have been poised
upon our feet in the state of what is called
“unstable equilibrium”—a state quite incompatible
with security or strength, and which would
have rendered the assistance of the upper limbs
essential to either standing or walking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>An instance of a similar kind of mechanism
to this of the joints between the foot and the
leg is presented by the mode in which the head
is secured upon the back-bone. We can nod the
head upwards and downwards; we can turn it
to either side in so free a manner that we are
able to command with our eyes the whole circle
in which we sit simply by the movements of
the head; and we can incline the head to the
right or to the left. Any of these movements
may be made very quickly; and there is a separate
joint or joints for each of them. Thus, the
<i>nodding</i> movement takes place between the head
and the first vertebra or uppermost bone of the
spine; the <i>turning</i> of the head from side to side
takes place between the first and second vertebræ,
the head with the first vertebra rotating upon a
pivot projected upwards from the second vertebra;
and the <i>inclination</i> of the head from side to side
takes place by movements of the second vertebra
upon the third, of the third upon the fourth, and
so on. The result is that, although the movements
are thus varied, they are free as well as rapid. Yet
the head is so well poised and so strongly fixed
that the neck is able to bear it all day long without
fatigue; and, as though the weight of the
head, which is by no means inconsiderable, were
not enough for the neck, we are in the habit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
selecting this as the part upon which to carry burdens.
One never feels so strongly impressed with
the carrying capabilities of the neck and the ankle,
as when following men and women in mountain
districts toiling up and down the hills under great
bundles of hay, baskets full of bitter beer, and
various things intended to minister to the comfort
and luxury of travellers and the inhabitants at
the top. So effectual, indeed, are the provisions
for security that, notwithstanding the freedom and
variety of their movements, the joints of the foot
with the leg, and of the head with the spine, are,
in proportion to their size, the strongest in the
body.</p>

<p>I have stated the movements that take place
in the three joints of the foot with the leg in a
simple manner, for the sake of avoiding confusion.
In reality, however, they are not so simple, but
very difficult to analyse and make out correctly.
The difficulty is due, partly, to the close proximity
of the joints to one another, which renders it no
easy matter to distinguish the movements of one
from those of the others, and, partly, to the fact
that the movements in each joint are a little oblique.</p>

<p>In the latter respect the foot-joints resemble
most of the others in the body; and it is this <i>obliquity</i>
in the movements of the joints, added to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the <i>curves</i> and <i>twists</i> in the shape of the bones,
that constitutes one of the chief difficulties in
investigating and clearly understanding the mechanism
of the human frame. It has been said
that “Nature abhors a vacuum:” it may with
equal truth be said that she abhors a straight line.
In the Human Skeleton, at any rate, all the bones
are bent and twisted, some in two or three directions;
and the surfaces by which any bone is
jointed to the adjacent bones, are invariably oblique
with regard to each other.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the <i>tibia</i>, or large bone of
the leg, of which a front view and an inner side
view are given in the drawings. The tibia is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
column transmitting weight from the thigh to the
foot; and in any machine of man’s construction a
column fulfilling similar purposes would be made
straight and of uniform diameter throughout. The
bone, on the contrary, does not present the same
thickness at any two parts of its length. It has
a distinct bend, forwards, in nearly its whole
length (fig. 10): there are lateral curves, alternating
like those in the letter S, seen along its
front (fig. 9): and the articular surface at the
lower end is placed obliquely with regard to that
at its upper end, in consequence of a twist in
the shaft, in such a manner that when the
hinder surface of the upper end of the bone rests
upon a board, the lower end touches the board
only by its outer corner (fig. 10). This disposition
of the lower end, I may remark, assists to
give the foot a slant outwards from the heel to
the toe, so that when we stand, with the heels
together, the great toes of the two feet diverge
a little from one another.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="f10" style="max-width: 23.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f10.jpg" alt="Medial view of tibia">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_10">10</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>Moreover, the surfaces by which the tibia is
jointed with the thigh-bone at the knee are arranged
with a varying degree of obliquity, so
that the relation of the leg to the thigh varies
somewhat in different positions of the limb. For
instance, when we stand upright, the <i>thigh</i> slants
<i>in</i>wards from the pelvis, and the <i>leg</i> descends
in a <i>vertical</i> direction to the ground. While,
however, the knee is being bent the leg is carried,
not in a vertical plane, but a little obliquely,
so that the lower part soon begins to slant <i>out</i>wards;
and when the knee is fully bent the obliquity
of the leg and that of the thigh correspond,
and the leg is, as it were, folded up against the
thigh. The heel is thus brought up, not to the
middle line of the body, but to the hip, and we
are enabled to sit with the hips upon the heels, as
the Japanese are represented doing, or with one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
hip upon one heel—a position in which our
riflemen are trained to take aim, and in which
their predecessors with the arrow were wont to
shoot, as is shown by the accompanying sketch
of a bowman (fig. 11), taken from one of the Æginetan
marbles in the Glyptothek at Munich.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp100" id="f11" style="max-width: 11.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f11.jpg" alt="Sketch of kneeling bowman">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_11">11</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A variety of purposes is attained by the curvilinear
shape of the bones and the obliquity in
the movements of the joints. Not the least of
these is the appearance of elegance and ease which
is given to the whole frame, both when it is at
rest and when it is in motion. In order that you
may fully appreciate this result, I would ask you,
the next time you are in a gallery of antique statuary,
to contrast the figures which the Egyptians
have left us with those by the Greeks. In the
former you will find that straight lines and right
angles prevail: the figure sits, probably, bolt
upright, with the elbows, hips, knees, and ankles
bent at right angles: the fingers commonly run
straight forwards; and a hand is often laid upon
each knee, the limbs of the two sides being quite
symmetrically placed. Such statues may be imposing;
but they are stiff and unnatural. They
represent positions which the body rarely assumes;
and they, certainly, are far from pleasing. Very
different is the Greek statuary. A correct representation
of nature is the great difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
and the highest consummation of art; and the
Greeks evinced their greatness in art by a true
appreciation and close imitation of natural form.
The position of their figures is life-like; and,
therefore, we love to contemplate them. The
outline in them exhibits a graceful disposition
of curves and obliques; and it is because the
great sculptors of Greece were, in this and in
other respects, so true to nature that their works
have commanded the admiration, and served as
models for the imitation, of all succeeding ages.</p>

<p>It is one of the master results of creation,
and one of the peculiar marks of creative genius,
that <i>perfection</i> and <i>beauty</i> are usually presented
together. As truth is the soul of eloquence, so
is perfection the soul of beauty. The works of
nature are beautiful because there is so much
excellence in them, such admirable adaptation to
their purpose; and we find the works of man
beautiful only so far as they are correct imitations
of their great originals in nature, or show
some approach to nature’s excellence. And man
is the most beautiful object in nature because
he is the most perfect, that is, because the purpose
of his existence is the highest, and because
his physique exhibits the most marvellous moulding
to adapt it to its high purpose; because, in
short, in him the material is wrought to such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
point of refinement as to be the receptacle and
minister of the immaterial.</p>

<p>The movements of the three joints between
the foot and the leg take place in harmony.
The following is the order observed. The raising
of the <i>heel</i> is accompanied by a rolling of
the foot <i>in</i>wards, and by an increased <i>flexure</i> of
the plantar arch; and the raising of the <i>toes</i> is
accompanied by a rolling of the foot <i>out</i>wards
and a <i>straightening</i> of the sole.</p>


<h3><i>The Muscles of the Leg and Foot.</i></h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp77" id="f12" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f12.jpg" alt="Muscles and tendons that raise the heel">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_12">12</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <i>first</i> series of the movements just described
is effected, mainly, by three muscles. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
these one (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>, fig. 12) raises the heel while the
other two (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>, fig. 12, and <span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>, fig. <a href="#f13">13</a>) raise and
support the ankle. The muscle which acts upon
the heel is one of the largest and most powerful
in the body; and well it may be, for in
raising the heel it has to raise the whole weight
of the body. Its fibres, accumulated at the middle
and upper part of the leg, form the “calf;” below
they taper into a thick tendon (a) connected
with the hinder extremity of the heel-bone, and
called the <i>Tendo Achillis</i>. The name, it need
scarcely be said, refers to the tale of Thetis
holding her son Achilles by this part when she
dipped him in the river Styx. Her hand prevented
the part from coming in contact with
the water; and so it did not partake of the invulnerability
which was conferred upon the rest
of his body by the immersion. We read, accordingly,
he was finally killed by a wound in
the heel‍<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>
<p>The other two muscles (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>) also descend
from the leg and terminate in tendons (b and c)
which pass, one on either side, behind the projections
(<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>) which we call respectively the
inner and outer ankle, to the inner and outer edges
of the instep. They assist to raise the ankle, and
support it so as to prevent its swerving from side
to side; and they permit it to play to and fro upon
them, like a pulley upon ropes running under it,
in a safe and easy manner. The inner (b, fig. 12)
of the two tendons passes, as before mentioned,
beneath the head of the key-bone, and adds
greatly to the strength of the arch. It is, moreover,
the chief agent in effecting the two movements
which are associated with the elevation of
the heel, viz. the turning of the sole inward and
the flexion of the foot.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp70" id="f13" style="max-width: 20.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f13.jpg" alt="Muscles and tendons that raise the toes">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_13">13</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <i>second</i> series of movements—the raising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>the toes, the turning the sole downwards, and the
straightening the foot—are effected by two muscles
(<span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>, fig. <a href="#f12">12</a>, and <span class="lowercase smcap">G</span>, fig. 13), the tendons
(f and g) of which pass, one in front of the inner
ankle, and the other in front of the outer ankle,
to the respective edges of the instep. These require
much less power than their opponents; and
the muscles on the front of the leg are, therefore,
smaller and weaker than those behind.</p>

<p>A question of practical interest here suggests
itself. How is the balance between these antagonistic
muscles maintained, and the proper position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
of the foot preserved? If the muscles which
cause the elevation of the heel and the other
movements associated with it are so much stronger
than those which produce the opposite series of
movements, and if, as we know to be the case,
muscles are always, even when a limb is at rest,
contracting with a certain amount of force, why
do not those of superior power gain and maintain
the ascendancy, and hold the limb in the position
to which they have a tendency to draw it? And
why, in this instance, are not the feet kept with
the heels raised and the soles inturned and bent?
The reply is, that the ill consequence suggested
is prevented, and a proper adjustment between
the opponent sets of muscles, in this and other
parts of the body, is effected through the medium
of the nervous system. That system institutes
friendly relations, and compels an orderly and
harmonious action of the several muscles; and it
does so by frequently exerting its influence upon
them, keeping them in drill, as it were, and enforcing
the habit of yielding in a kindly manner
to one another.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp27" id="f14" style="max-width: 6.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f14.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_14">14</a>.<br>Club-foot.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You have often observed, and perhaps wondered
at, the almost incessant, semi-involuntary
and, seemingly, meaningless movements of infants,
especially the peculiar sprawlings out of their
fingers and toes. Now these are for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of keeping the different sets of muscles in practice
and in order, till the will acquires a due control,
when they gradually cease. They are going on
before birth as well as afterwards; and when they
are deficient, or when they take place irregularly,
in consequence of an imperfection in the nervous
system, the limbs are liable to become deformed.
The feet, under these circumstances, are often
drawn into the very position I have just mentioned;
the sole is turned inwards and upwards,
so as never to touch the ground; the heel and
the toes are approximated; and the foot rests upon
the ground on the outer side, or quite on the fore
part, of the instep. Such a condition constitutes
one of the most common forms of what is called
“club foot.” Children are often born with one or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
both of their feet thus distorted. Happily, however,
if they be submitted in time to the modern
improved modes of treatment they may usually
be set right. The accompanying woodcut gives a
sketch of the foot of a young woman who had
not the good fortune to be thus attended to.</p>

<p>The muscles compose the flesh or chief part of
the bulk of a limb. The “calf” is almost entirely
made up of the fibres of the “calf-muscle.” But
at the ankle there are no muscles. As they descend
the leg, all the <i>muscular</i> fibres disappear,
and there are only <i>tendons</i>. These, though much
thinner than the muscles, are very strong; and
they are the cords or ropes by which the muscles
pull upon distant parts. As they pass over the
ankle they are strapped down close to the bones
by means of stout sinewy cross-bands, which prevent
their starting from their places when the
muscular portions pull at them.</p>

<p>Two especial advantages result from this
arrangement.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, the lower part of the leg and the ankle
are reduced in size. Thereby the resistance to
the passage of the limb through the air is lessened;
and when it is upon the ground, the leg is
less in the way of the other foot which is swinging,
to and fro, beside it. An elegance of shape is also
thereby imparted. The “pretty ankle” owes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
much of its charm to the mode in which the tendons
are disposed. How comparatively thick and
clumsy would the ankle be if the tendons of the
toes took the straight course represented by the
line <i>a</i> in the drawing, instead of being bound
down, as they are, to the curve of the ankle!</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp57" id="f15" style="max-width: 9.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f15.jpg" alt="Shows ligaments restraining tendons on front of ankle">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_15">15</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, the obliquity with which the tendons
run to their insertions is increased by this arrangement;
and the velocity of the movements to
which they minister is increased also. True, a
loss of strength is involved in such a disposition,
but the gain in velocity is of more importance.
If (to refer again to the diagram, fig. 15) the tendon
ran in a straight course from the front of the
leg to the great toe, the angle at which it joined
the toe would enable it to act with more strength;
but the movements connected with it could not be
so quick as they now are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>We find in the construction of the human
frame many instances in which strength is sacrificed
to rapidity of movement in this and other
ways. Scarcely any conceivable amount of
strength, for instance, would be an adequate compensation
for a loss of that celerity of movement
of the hand which enables us to strike a blow and
drive a nail. No wonder, therefore, that strength
is here sacrificed to obtain celerity. And the
same principle holds good for other parts.</p>

<p>The length and direction of the heel affords a
good illustration of the principle of which I am
speaking. When the heel-bone runs out to a considerable
distance, and nearly straight, behind the
ankle, as it does in some of the lower animals and in
the inferior races of mankind, it presents a better
leverage to the calf-muscle, which is, then, enabled
to raise the ankle with a less amount of effort;
but there is proportionately less velocity. Accordingly,
in the more perfectly formed foot, such as
we find it in the higher races of mankind, the
heel-bone, instead of running out backwards,
descends very obliquely, almost vertically.</p>

<p>In this instance, the loss of strength, which
is thus incurred for the purpose of acquiring
celerity in movement, is usually compensated for
by the greater development of the calf-muscle.
Hence the high heel and the well-developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
calf go together; and, like most of the other
features of good bodily formation, they are, on
the whole, best marked in the nations which are
endued with the highest intelligence, and which
are, in this way, physically, as well as mentally,
qualified to occupy the foremost places in the
human family. Thus, we may mark a relation
between the heel and the brain; and, as the
comparative anatomist is able by the inspection
of a bone to trace out the skeleton to which it
belonged, so might it be possible for the human
anatomist, by observing minutely the peculiarities
of the heel and the other features of the
foot in any particular race of men, to form some
estimate of the capacity and conformation of the
skull, and thereby, of the amount of intelligence.</p>

<p>Contrast the foot and leg of the <span class="smcap">European</span>
(fig. 16), as represented in the drawing reduced
from the Farnese Hercules, with those of the
<span class="smcap">Negro</span> (fig. 17), the drawing of which was taken
from a native of Sierra Leone. In the former
the leg is plump and the calf well developed;
the foot is compact and well arched; the heel
descends nearly vertically; and the inner ankle
stands clearly out and is raised high above the
ground. In the Negro the leg is thinner and
the calf is not so well defined; the foot is long,
flat, and sprawling; the heel is more horizontal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
and the inner ankle does not show clearly, and
almost touches the ground.</p>

<p>Contrast also the outline (fig. 19) of the foot of
the same Negro with that (fig. 18) of an Englishman.
Both were traced upon the ground, and reduced
upon the same scale. The Negro was 5 ft.
2 in. in height; the Englishman was 6 ft.; both were
of the same age: yet the Negro’s foot was considerably
the larger. It was 11 inches long, <span class="nowrap">3 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> inches
across the middle of the instep, and <span class="nowrap">10 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> inches
round the balls of the toes. Whereas the Englishman’s
foot was less than <span class="nowrap">10 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> inches long, was <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
inches across the middle of the instep, and <span class="nowrap">9 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>
inches round the balls of the toes. Even in this
simple outline how much less shapely is the African’s
foot. Some allowance must be made for the
fact that the Negro was more accustomed to go
barefooted than the Englishman; and the pressure
of the boot or shoe has, in some degree, the effect
of giving compactness to the foot.</p>

<p>In the native <span class="smcap">Australian</span> the leg is commonly
still more lanky, there being less calf than
in the African; and in the <span class="smcap">Monkey</span> the heel
is quite horizontal, the sole is flat, and the muscular
fibres of the leg are continued low down,
close to the ankle, instead of being concentrated
higher up; so that the leg has nearly the same
thickness from the knee to the foot, and there
is no calf at all. Indeed, in the <span class="smcap">Gorilla</span> (see
fig. at page <a href="#Page_91">91</a>) the circumference of the leg increases
towards the ankle. Thus, the calf may
be regarded as the characteristic of <span class="smcap">Man</span>; and
a well-developed calf is a characteristic of the
higher members of the human species. The pride,
therefore, which is felt in a well-formed leg is
not altogether a senseless folly, but finds some
excuse in the fact that its foundation lies deep in
the laws of physiology and ethnology. It must
be confessed, that the fashion which, in the last
century, dictated the knee-breeches, the silk stocking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
and the shoe, evinced a truer appreciation of
the dignity and beauty of the human figure than
do the modern investments, which quite cover up
the limbs, encumbering their movements and
hiding the beauty of the leg and ankle.</p>

<p>In the addition of the <i>high heel</i> to the shoe
we recognise an effort to improve upon the original,
by exaggerating one of the peculiar features
of the human foot; but it results in a failure,
as is invariably the case with such strainings after
a greater perfection than nature has given. It
increases the apparent height of the person and
of the arch of the instep; but it throws the
weight too forward upon the toes, and detracts
from the length and security of the step. Moreover,
by causing disuse of the elevators of the
heel, it interferes with the full growth of the
calf.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp81" id="f20" style="max-width: 11.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f20.jpg" alt="Deformed Chinese foot">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_20">20</a>. Chinese.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is, however, a harmless piece of vanity
in comparison with the monstrous efforts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Chinese to mould the foot to their ideal by
squeezing the heel and the toes together. They
effect this to such a degree that (fig. 20) the
heel-bone descends vertically from the ankle, the
plantar arch is bent to an acute angle, and the
foot is so crumpled up that all movement in it
is effectually prevented, and the part is reduced
almost to a mere stump. These observant and
ingenious people have caught, it may be, the idea
that compactness, elevation of instep, and sudden
descent of heel are characteristics of the well-formed
foot, and may urge that they are helping
nature to perfection in the direction which she
has herself indicated. But in their silly attempt
at the preternatural, in this impious use, as it
were, of fire stolen from heaven, they simply
burn and cripple themselves, and render themselves
ridiculous, and give to all other nations
the much needed lesson that it is enough for
man to follow as a humble imitator of his Maker’s
works, and that his attempts to alter, or improve
upon, any part of the wondrous design of creation
will assuredly have the effect of spoiling
and defacing it‍<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>
<p>It seems that the several races of mankind are
usually rather proud of their peculiarities, and
that each has an inclination to make much of,
and artificially exaggerate, the points in which it
differs from the others. Thus the Chinese are
remarkable for the spareness of their hair and
the smallness of their feet; so the men shave
their heads, leaving only the pig-tail, and the
women squeeze up their feet in the remorseless
manner we have seen. The Singhalese, who are
flat-footed, are said to consider it one of the requisites
for a ‘belle’ that the soles of her feet
should not have any hollow. The red Indians of
America delight in staining and painting their
skins of a lively red colour. The Columbian tribe
of Indians increase the natural lowness of their
forehead by flattening it out in infancy, and
succeed in bringing about a deformation of the
skull almost as remarkable in its way as is the
effect of Chinese cramping upon the foot. These
people also take pains to reduce the small quantity
of hair upon their eyebrows, lips, and chin,
by plucking it out.</p>

<p>I will briefly draw your attention to one other
point in the anatomy of the foot; and that is,
the mode in which the “metatarsal” bones are
jointed with the “tarsal.” If you take hold of the
ends of the metatarsal bones—in other words the
“balls”—of the great toe and of the two toes
next to it, in your own foot, you will find that
you can move them scarcely at all; they are
firmly set upon the rest of the foot, almost as
though they formed one piece with it. If you
then try the end of the metatarsal bone of the
fourth toe you will be able to move it a little
upwards and downwards; and in the case of
the little toe the movement is still more distinct.
This difference depends upon the mode
of construction of the joints of the metatarsal
bones with the tarsal, which is easily understood
by the aid of the accompanying drawings, representing
sections, from above downwards, through
these joints. In 21, 22, and 23, which are the
tarso-metatarsal joints of the great toe and the
two next it, the opposed surfaces of the bones
between <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, are quite flat, so that the only
movement that can take place is a slight sliding
of one bone upon the other, just enough to assist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
in breaking the jar, but not enough to interfere
with the firm basis of support which these toes
are required to afford to the plantar arch in consequence
of the great stress of the weight in walking
being borne upon this side of the foot. In No. 24,
which is the joint of the ring toe, and still more in
No. 25, which is the joint of the little toe, the end
of the metatarsal bone (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>) is rounded and is received
into a corresponding concavity or cup in the tarsal
bone (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>). This allows a slight revolving of one bone
upon the other to take place, and permits the
movement which you discover when you grasp the
balls of these two toes between your fingers. The
outer part of the foot needs not to be so strong and
firm as the inner part, because it does not lie so
nearly in the plane of gravity during walking; and
the provision just described, which permits some
movement in the outer two metatarsals, enables
the balls of the toes to adapt themselves to inequalities
on the ground, and to share more equally,
under various circumstances, the weight which is
thrown upon them.</p>

<p>When we <span class="smcap">Stand</span> straight upright (fig. 26) the
centre of gravity of the head is directly over a
point midway between the two ankles; and the
plane of gravity, represented by the vertical line
in the figure, descends, from the head, through the
spine, pelvis, and lower limbs, to the key-bone of
the instep. And you observe that, between the
head and the ankle, the skeleton is not quite
straight, but is arranged in six curves, which are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
alternately, in front of and behind the line of gravity.
Of these curves the upper three are in the
spine. They are well marked; the uppermost (<i>a</i>)
is in the neck and is directed forwards; the next
(<i>b</i>) is in the back and is directed backwards; the
third (<i>c</i>) is in the loins and is directed forwards.
The fourth curve (<i>d</i>), less distinct than those above
it, is in the pelvis and is directed backwards. The
fifth and sixth curves are very slight; the fifth (<i>e</i>),
directed forwards, is at the hip-joint; and the sixth,
(<i>f</i>), directed backwards, is at the knee. The last
two curves, though slight, are not unimportant;
and they contribute very much to our comfort
and to prevent fatigue when we are standing: they
do so in the following way. The strong ligaments
of the hip are placed towards the <i>fore</i> part of the
joint, that is, in <i>front</i> of the line of gravity; and
the strong ligaments of the knee are placed towards
the <i>back</i> part of the joint, that is, <i>behind</i>
the line of gravity. It follows that when these
joints are fully extended they are “locked,” as it
is termed, just as is a hinge when opened to a
little beyond the straight line; and, by this means,
the muscles are set at rest, and we are able to
maintain the erect posture, for some time, steadily
and without fatigue.</p>

<p>When standing upright in this way, at rest on
both legs, or on one leg in the military position of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
“at ease,” and the muscles are off their guard, if a
sudden and unexpected, though slight, pressure be
made upon the ham, so as to bend the knee a
little and throw the joint in front of the line of
gravity, the man will drop, unless the muscles
come quickly to the rescue—a tendency which has
not escaped the observation of school-boys.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Bending</span> or <span class="smcap">Bowing</span> (fig. <a href="#f27">27</a>) the head is
carried forwards; and, to maintain the balance, the
opposite pole of the trunk is carried backwards,
so as to preserve the line of gravity still over the
ankles.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Stooping</span> (fig. <a href="#f28">28</a>) or <span class="smcap">Squatting</span> (fig. <a href="#f29">29</a>),
as in picking up any thing from the ground, the
lower limbs and the trunk are bent in a zigzag
manner; the heels are raised; and the plane of
gravity falls, in front of the ankles, over the balls
of the toes. Now we recognise one of the advantages
which accrues to man from the great length
of his thigh. For the head and upper part of the
trunk are advanced so far in <i>front</i> of the feet, that
it would be impossible to maintain a balance at
all, even upon the balls of the toes, and we
should necessarily fall forwards, were it not that,
owing to the length of the thigh, the lower part
of the trunk is carried backwards to a plane <i>behind</i>
the heels, and so serves to maintain the
equilibrium.</p>

<p>Let us next consider the part which the foot
performs in <span class="smcap">Walking</span>. To understand this it is
necessary to consider its positions and movements
in the several stages of a step. When first placed
upon the ground the foot (<span class="lowercase smcap">R</span>, fig. 30) is a little in
advance of the body; and the heel comes first (fig. 33)
into contact with the ground. The toes quickly
follow; and the body, then, passes, vertically, over,
the ankle and the key-bone of the instep. The foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
(<span class="lowercase smcap">R</span>, fig. 31 and fig. 34) now rests steadily upon the
heel and the balls of the toes; the other foot (<span class="lowercase smcap">L</span>)
leaves the ground, so that the whole weight is
borne by one foot; and the plantar arch of that
foot expands a little, so as to cause slight lengthening
of the foot, under the weight that is laid
upon it. Much yielding of the arch is, however,
prevented by the ligaments that brace the arch
(fig. <a href="#f07">7</a>), and by the muscles that are disposed beneath
it. Next, the heel (fig. 35) is raised by the
action of the calf muscle, and the weight of the
body is thrown forwards, over the balls of the toes,
while the other foot (<span class="lowercase smcap">L</span>, fig. 32) is carried onwards,
and is placed upon the ground ready to receive the
weight and commence its carrying work. When
this has been done the foot is withdrawn from the
ground; and, in the withdrawal, a final impulse
onward is given, so as to throw the weight of the
body fairly over to the other foot. The fore part
of the foot is then raised, and the knee is bent a
little. By these means the toes are kept clear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the ground, while the foot is swung forward, beside
the other, so as to be ready again to rest upon
the ground and bear the weight of the body.</p>

<p>In each complete step, therefore, there is a period
during which the foot rests upon the ground,
and a period in which it is swinging in the air. In
walking the former period is considerably longer
than the latter; and at the commencement, and at
the end, of that period (figs. <a href="#f30">30</a> and 32) the other
foot is also upon the ground, so that it is only
during the middle of the time (fig. <a href="#f31">31</a>) in which
the foot rests upon the ground that it has to bear
the whole weight of the body.</p>


<h3><i>Running.</i></h3>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Running</span> the process is much the same as
in walking. The chief difference is that, whereas
in walking <i>both</i> feet are never <i>off</i> the ground at
the same time, and both are <i>upon</i> the ground at
the beginning and end of each step; in running
<i>both</i> feet are never <i>on</i> the ground at the same
time, and both are <i>off</i> the ground, and the body is
flying unsupported through the air, at the beginning
and end of each step (figs. 36 and 38). Thus,
you may always distinguish running, though it be
ever so slow, from walking, because, in the latter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the two feet are upon the ground at the same
time; while, in the former, only one foot touches
the ground at a time.</p>

<p>The period during which the body rests upon
the ground in running is comparatively very short,
being merely the time when one foot is set down
in the middle of each step (fig. 37); and great force
has, consequently, to be exerted to propel the body
through the air during the whole remainder of the
step. Hence the exertion of running is much
greater than that of walking. In slow running the
same parts of the foot are applied upon the ground
as in walking, and in the same order; but in quick
running the balls of the toes only touch the ground.
The quicker we run the shorter, relatively to the
rest of the step, is the time during which the foot
rests upon the ground, and the greater, consequently,
is the effort.</p>

<p>After the foot leaves the ground, in running, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
is thrown up behind; and, at the same time, the
fore part of the sole and the toes are turned a
little obliquely <i>in</i>wards, so as to prevent their
catching against adjacent objects. If the toes
were turned <i>out</i>, when thrown up behind, it would
present a very awkward appearance, and we should
frequently be tripped up by their coming in contact
with substances near which we pass. While the
foot is being swung forwards the toes are gradually
turned a little the other way. Thus, by the time
they pass the other leg the toes have lost the inclination
inwards, and are directed straight <i>for</i>wards;
and when the foot has reached a point in advance
of the other leg, and the sole is preparing to present
itself to the ground, the toes are turned a
little <i>out</i>wards. This turning of the foot <i>in</i>wards
and <i>out</i>wards during its movement <i>back</i>wards and
<i>for</i>wards, in each step, is a graceful movement,
and may be compared to the “feathering” of an
oar. It takes place, also, in walking, but is less
marked than in running; and in many persons it
can scarcely be discerned during walking.</p>

<p>The distinction between the paces of other animals
resembles that between the walking and the
running of man, and is equally definite. Take, for
instance, the <span class="smcap">Walking</span>, <span class="smcap">Trotting</span>, and <span class="smcap">Galloping</span>
of the Horse. In <span class="smcap">Walking</span> the fore and the
hind limbs of the <i>same</i> side are moved together, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
nearly together, but they do not leave the ground
till the limbs of the opposite side are placed upon
it; so that at one period all four limbs are upon
the ground together. In <span class="smcap">Trotting</span> the fore and
the hind limbs of <i>opposite</i> sides move together; but,
as in walking, neither of them are withdrawn from
the ground till the opposite one has reached it‍<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Galloping</span>, or <span class="smcap">Cantering</span>, the horse springs
or bounds with all four limbs at the same time;
all the feet are thrown up nearly together; all are
off the ground together; and all reach the ground
again nearly at the same time ready for another
spring. I say that the feet are all thrown up
<i>nearly</i>, and not <i>quite</i>, together, because the fore
and the hind limbs of one side take the precedence
a little of the others, or “lead,” as it is called.
The trained horse is taught to lead, habitually,
with one, usually the right, side, because the motion
is more steady when the horse is accustomed
to gallop in one way than if he be allowed to vary
it. Directly the horse begins to gallop, the rider
knows, by the motion, whether he is leading with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the proper leg. In some animals, as the <span class="smcap">Deer</span>,
the two fore and the two hind feet move together
exactly in galloping. Anthony Trollope tells us that
in Panama, Cuba, and other Spanish countries in
the West, the horses are “taught to pace, that is,
move with the two off legs together, and then with
the two near legs. The motion is exceedingly gentle,
and well fitted for those hot climates, in which
the rougher work of trotting would be almost too
much for the energies of debilitated mankind.”
This <i>pacing</i> is probably only a quick walk.</p>

<p>When we walk the heels follow one another
nearly in a straight line, as is shewn by “walking
a chalk,” or more readily by walking along the
line between the curb and the flagstone pavement;
and the plane of gravity of the body corresponds
with this line. There ought, therefore, to be no
perceptible <i>swerving</i> of the trunk from side to
side in walking. There should, also, be scarcely
any <i>rising</i> or <i>falling</i>; inasmuch as there are provisions
in the mode of bending the limbs (which I
cannot here discuss) to prevent the body from being
moved up and down during the step. The head
and shoulders should be carried along nearly in
a straight line. If it were otherwise, if they were
moved in a zigzag or undulating manner, from
right to left, or up and down, the space traversed
in a given distance would be much increased, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
there would be a proportionately greater expenditure
of muscular force. By a beautiful combination
of movements this is prevented, and a rectilinear
course is maintained, while the weight of
the body is transferred from foot to foot, in a
succession of steps.</p>

<p>Only observe a good walker for a minute or
two, and you will see how straight the head is
carried along; and when your eye falls upon a
person who “rolls in his walk” you perceive how
ungainly are his movements, and you have an instinctive
feeling that he is an awkward fellow.
Whether you are disposed to make an exception
in favour of the British tar, in consequence of his
many other good qualities, I must leave you to
judge. His peculiar gait on shore is probably due
to his not being sufficiently practised in straight
walking to counteract the effect of the lounging
manner and general disregard for appearances
which he acquires on board ship. Whatever the
reason may be, though he has the better of us
in a storm at sea, he certainly does not always
appear to advantage on <i>terra firma</i>. Now that
a general improvement in gait and step may be
expected among landsmen, as a result of the volunteer
movement, it becomes still more desirable
that the sailor should participate in the good influences
of the drill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>Although the heels follow one another in a
line the toes diverge a little from the line, because
the foot slants, as I have just said, somewhat
<i>out</i>wards when it is placed upon the ground.
It results from this position of the foot that the
weight of the body descends upon it with a slight
obliquity, <i>in</i>wards as well as forwards; and that
is precisely the direction in which the foot is best
prepared to receive weight. For, when the foot
rests upon the ground in this position all the ligaments
on the inner side (and they are very strong)
as well as those beneath, are on the stretch; and
the joints, with the exception of the ankle-joint,
are as it were locked, so as to afford a secure,
steady basis of support to the leg. When the
weight of the body descends upon the foot in the
direction mentioned a sprain rarely occurs. It is
when the weight falls in the opposite direction,
that is, more or less obliquely <i>out</i>wards, and throws
the ankle out, that a sprain easily happens. Thus
a slight inequality of the ground, or any other
cause that tilts up the inner edge of the foot,
is likely to lead to a sprain, especially when we
are going down hill or down steps.</p>

<p>Here let me remark that a <span class="smcap">Sprain</span> is the
result of a stretching of some ligament, or other
part, caused by an undue force being brought to
bear upon it. The ligaments are very strong,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
and under ordinary circumstances are not very
sensitive; and they are capable of offering great
resistance to force applied in the direction in
which they are calculated to meet it. But, if the
force be applied in a direction in which they are
not calculated to meet it, they are easily injured,
and they become, then, very painful. The same
is, also, likely to occur if the force be severe or
sudden.</p>

<p>The muscles are a very great assistance to the
ligaments, forasmuch as, by placing and retaining
the joints in proper positions, they regulate the
direction in which forces are brought to bear upon
the ligaments. Moreover, by steadying or bracing
the joints, they check or break the force and
prevent its being suddenly imposed upon the ligaments.
And the muscles, by virtue of their contractile
property, have the capability of becoming
tight in any position of the joint, which is an immense
advantage; whereas a ligament having no
contractility and, usually, no elasticity, is tight
only in one position. The office of a ligament is
to limit the movement of a joint in a particular
direction; and, till the joint has assumed a certain
position—till it is bent or straightened to a
certain angle—the ligament does not come into
play. During the bending or straightening of a
limb the muscles regulate the movement, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
bring it to a stop or check it before it has gone
to its full extent; and, thus, the ligament is relieved
from that sudden imposition of force which
would result if it were required to check the
movement of a joint in its full swing.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the muscles are prepared
and in proper action, that is, when they place
the joint in a suitable position and duly support
or brace it, a sprain very rarely occurs. It is
when the muscles are unprepared, when we make
a false step, or when the foot encounters an unexpected
obstacle, and the weight falls suddenly
upon the ligaments in an unfavourable direction,
that a sprain occurs. A man jumps from a considerable
height, or descends deep steps with a
heavy weight upon his back, and no harm results;
but he slips off the curb-stone, or treads
unwarily upon a piece of orange-peel, or turns his
foot hastily, to avoid some object on the ground,
and sprains his ankle.</p>

<p>In order that they may do their work well,
be alert, and maintain good guard, the muscles
need to be kept in practice. A person unaccustomed
to throw a ball is very liable to sprain his
elbow with the sudden jerk which is required for
that feat; or if a person takes to tumbling and
jumping, without proper training, he will probably
suffer for his temerity. Again, common experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
tells us that a joint which has been sprained
is, for a long time, liable to be sprained again.
This is because the part remains tender as well
as weak; and the muscles do not brace it steadily
and firmly, or come nimbly to its aid when it
is in danger.</p>

<p>In consequence of the foot, in walking, being
placed upon the ground with the toes slanting
a little outwards, the <i>out</i>er and hinder edge of
the heel first touches the ground. Hence this
part of the heel of the shoe is usually worn down
before the remainder. The ball of the little toe
next comes to the ground, and the balls of the
other toes follow in quick succession; and it is
from the great toe—that is, from the inner side
of the foot—that the last impulse is given to
propel the body, forwards, over the other foot.
In order to give full effect to this final impulse
an especial muscle, the “Long Fibular” muscle
(<span class="lowercase smcap">I</span> in fig. <a href="#f13">13</a>), is provided. The tendon (i) of this
muscle passes, behind the outer ankle, beneath
the sole of the foot, to the great toe. It has the
effect of pressing the ball of the great toe upon
the ground, while it raises the outer ankle, and
so contributes to throw the weight, across, in the
direction of the other foot.</p>

<p>Thus the foot revolves upon the ground, from
the heel to the balls of the toes, and from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
outer edge of the former to the inner edge of the
latter; and during the revolution, which has been
compared, though the comparison fails in many
points, to the revolving of the segment of a wheel,
the ankle is raised and advanced forwards.</p>

<p>On the complete and steady execution of this
movement good walking chiefly depends, more
particularly upon the full performance of the last
stage of the process, viz. the rising fairly upon
the balls of the toes and delivering the weight
steadily over to the other foot. This is the most
difficult part of the process, the whole weight of
the body during its execution being borne upon the
fore part of the foot, that is, upon the longer pillar
of the plantar arch; forasmuch as the heel is being
raised and the other foot is off the ground. For
the good performance of this part of the process,
all the features of the well-made foot are essential.
There must be a high and firm plantar arch,
a heel set at a proper angle, and a strong great
toe running straight forwards. There must be
also a fully developed calf to set the machinery
well in motion.</p>

<p>If the plantar arch be low it cannot bear the
strain attendant upon this movement; and the
person, in consequence, shirks the full performance
of it. He does that by turning the toes too much
out; and, then, he contrives to roll over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
inner side of the foot, instead of rising upon the
balls of the toes; and so he gets along with short,
shuffling, feeble steps. How many persons, owing
to one cause or other, hobble in this way! Some
turn the toes very much in, and rise over the
ball of the little toe, instead of over the great toe.
This is done with comparative ease, because the
ball of the little toe is nearer to the ankle; but
the step is, thereby, shortened, as well as rendered
less firm and less graceful.</p>

<p>The revolving movement of the foot, or the
bringing of its several parts into contact with the
ground in succession, in a distinct manner, is
peculiar to man. Many animals do not bear upon
the heel at all; they only tread upon the toes,
and are, therefore, called <span class="smcap">Digitigrade</span>. Some,
indeed, bear only upon the tips of the toes, as the
Horse (fig. <a href="#f05">5</a>, p. 15). Others go upon the balls
of the toes, as the Cat, the Hare, the Pig, and
the Dog. Some animals bear upon the heels as
well as the toes, and are called <span class="smcap">Plantigrade</span>,
as the Bear, the Badger, and the Monkey; but
these all flop the sole upon the ground in its whole
length at once. The foot in them is not sufficiently
compact and strong to bear the weight of
the body first upon one part then upon another;
and they, consequently, walk in an ungainly manner,
as compared with man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>


<h3><i>Character evinced by manner of Walking.</i></h3>

<p>Bear in mind that for the firm vigorous walk
there is required, not only the well-formed limb,
but also the manly and determined <span class="smcap">Will</span>, acting
in a decided and authoritative manner over
the several members of the body, so that these
are accustomed readily, and steadily, to obey its
commands; just as the soldiers of a well-drilled
regiment obey the directions of the superior officer
in an orderly and efficient manner. And, as you
may judge of the character of the officer by the
discipline of his men, so may you form an estimate
of a man by the movements of his limbs.
You see a man walk along the street, and you
instinctively form an opinion of him by the mode
in which he carries himself and treads the ground.
Be careful not to allow yourselves to be inflexibly
biassed by these first impressions, as that
amounts to prejudice. Nevertheless, experience
tells us that they are not to be altogether despised.
They originate in a perception of the
working of the great laws by which body and
mind are harmonized; and, if fairly estimated,
they rarely deceive us.</p>

<p>We have little difficulty in recognising three
chief classes among pedestrians. <i>First</i>, there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
those who pay too much attention to the movements,
who walk with a pompous strut, or a mincing gait,
or affect some style or other. We are naturally
very little inclined in favour of such persons; indeed,
we have usually to make an effort not to
be decidedly prejudiced against them. <i>Secondly</i>,
there are those who pay too little attention to
their movements, who do not seem to be sufficiently
alive to the responsibility attaching to the
possessors of so noble a structure as the human
frame, and who do not give themselves the trouble
to exert the powers of the glorious mechanism
with which they are charged. They slouch, or
dawdle, along in a listless lazy manner. Instinct
tells us, and tells us rightly, to beware how we
trust such persons with the conduct of our affairs,
or with any office of responsibility. We feel that
the lack of energy manifested in the guidance of
their limbs is, too probably, a feature of character,
which unfits them for the active duties of life;
and we know that such men are not usually successful
in their calling. <i>Thirdly</i>, there are those
who shew, by the firmness and precision of their
step, and by the regularity in the succession of
the movements by which the step is made, that
they are conscious of the dignity of their species,
of the responsibility attendant on that dignity,
and of the respect due to themselves. Such men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
we feel are likely to pursue their avocations energetically
and methodically, as well as with punctuality.</p>

<p>Many points of character peep out in the way
men walk. Our poet tells us that in one we may
read</p>

<p class="tac fs85">
“rascal in the motions of his back<br>
And scoundrel in his supple sliding knee.”
</p>

<p class="ti0">Another has a halting, shuffling, undecided gait;
while a third walks in a bold, determined, straight-forward,
erect and independent manner. One
has a cautious, parsimonious step, as if sparing
of shoe-leather, or afraid to trust the ground; he
has, however, probably, trusted the funds with
considerable investments. Some walk with long,
pretentious, measured strides; others make short,
quick, insignificant steps. Some, again, are hurried,
fussy, noisy; while others glide along in a
quiet, shrinking, unpretending, it may be timid,
manner.</p>

<p>I need not dilate upon these diversities. Your
own observation will supply abundant illustrations
of the correspondence between character and
manner of walking.</p>

<p>The several movements in walking are under
the control of the <span class="lowercase smcap">WILL</span>, and are directed by it,
to such an extent that the continuous agency of
the will is essential to the process. If the influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of the will be suspended, but for a moment,
the action ceases, and the man falls to the ground.
Nevertheless, the play of the individual muscles,
and their co-ordination, or the manner in which
their several movements are combined, are, in a
great measure, independent of the will. They are,
to a certain extent, automatic, and result from
peculiar relations between the nervous and the
muscular systems. The will may be compared to
the driver of an engine, who, by turning on the
steam, and maintaining the supply, sets the machine
in motion, and regulates the rate of its
speed; but the several wheels are so arranged
that they go on irrespectively of his immediate
superintendence. It would be impossible for the
engine-man to attend to the working of each detail
of his machine; and it would be too much
for the will to have to direct all the movements
of the limbs in walking. We should be wearied
with such an effort of attention before we had
walked across a room; for the exercise of the will
is exhausting, and soon engenders fatigue. The
more we think of any movement and take pains
to direct it, the sooner we are tired and unable
to continue it; and the more the attention is
diverted, the less quickly do we experience a feeling
of exhaustion; while those movements in the
body which are not at all under the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the will—the movements of the heart for instance—go
on unceasingly, through a long life, without
any sense of weariness. What so prevents fatigue,
when we are walking, as the diverting conversation
of an agreeable companion?</p>

<p>But though the combination of the movements
in walking is, to a certain extent, automatic, it is
not complete without the proper control of the
will. This is proved by the gait of those unfortunate
beings in whom the mind, and with it commonly
the will, is deficient from birth—I mean
<span class="smcap">Idiots</span>. Their movements are, usually, more or
less, irregular and unharmonious, jerky, without
proper steadiness and rhythm; the head is tossed
about; the eye looks one way; the fingers are
sprawled out in another direction; the foot is
jerked out at a hazard, as it were, so that you
don’t know when it will reach the ground, perhaps
it kicks against the other foot. A sad spectacle
this. The visit to an Idiot Asylum fills one, it is
true, with a sense of the value of an institution
where these poor members of the human family
are kept out of harm’s way, and away from the
gibes of the village boys, and are made clean, and
tidy, and taught so far as they are capable of instruction;
but I know no sadder sight than is presented
by a string of the inmates of such an asylum,
guided from room to room by the foremost of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the number, who shews by his walk, somewhat
more steady than that of the others, that he is
gifted with rather more intelligence than they, and
is so fitted to be their guide.</p>

<p>An equally melancholy, an even more distressing,
spectacle is that of criminals pacing, like animals
in their dens, up and down the court-yard of
their prison; for in them we know, that there is
no deficiency of will. It is strong enough to control
and regulate the movements of their limbs;
but there is a still more important deficiency, viz.
a deficiency of that moral sense which should control
the will.</p>

<p>Another sad, but physiologically interesting,
sight is the rolling walk of the drunkard. Here,
again, the will is not deficient; but it is, partly,
and by its own agency, dethroned. Enough of the
will is left to set the machine going, not enough
to guide it and control it well. Though the movements
follow one another, for the most part, in
proper sequence, they are uncertain and ill-directed.
The balancing power is partly lost. The
feet are dragged hither and thither, and thrown
about, by the swerving weight of the body; and
they follow one another upon the ground at uncertain
intervals, and in any but a straight line.
You watch a man in this state staggering from
side to side, and wonder how he keeps his legs at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
all. Soon the foot catches against some slight obstacle
or against the other leg, or fails to come
quickly enough into the required place, and the
man rolls over. The supple manner in which his
unstrung limbs give under the weight, perhaps,
saves him, to some extent, from the shock; but
you must not imagine that drunkards have any
charm against injury. A large proportion of the
accidents admitted into our Hospitals are the result
of drunkenness.</p>


<h3><i>Distinctive Features of the Human Foot.</i></h3>

<p>I have already made a few comparisons between
the human foot and that of certain of the
lower animals. It will be interesting to add some
others.</p>

<p>There are several animals, as the Monkey, the
Bear, and some Reptiles, in which the foot resembles
the human foot in many particulars. It has,
for instance, the same number of toes as the human
foot, and the same, or nearly the same, number
of bones, and the latter disposed in much
the same manner. Certain peculiarities, however,
distinguish the human foot. These all have reference
to the power which man, and man alone,
possesses of standing firmly upright, and of walking
steadily, upon the two feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>The following are the most important of these
distinctive features.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The several parts are fitted and bound
together in a compact firm manner, so as to combine
strength and elasticity in the highest degree.
In this respect the human foot contrasts very
remarkably with the sprawling foot of the Seal
or Lizard (figs. <a href="#f02">2</a> and 3, p. 11). The result is
obtained, partly, by the great size of the tarsal
bones, in proportion to the other components of
the foot, and, partly, by the formation of the
“Plantar Arch,” which is higher and stronger in
man than in any of the lower animals.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The <span class="smcap">Toes</span> are short and small in
relation to the other parts of the foot. In many
animals, the Monkey for instance (fig. <a href="#f44">44</a>, p. 89),
the toes form the greater part of the foot; and,
in some, the bones of the instep are reduced in
number as well as in size: the reason being that,
in such animals, the toes are required to perform
a variety of offices—burrowing in the ground,
scratching, holding on to the branches of trees,
catching and tearing prey, &amp;c.—for which their
services are not needed by man.</p>

<p>It may here be noticed that one of the great
points of dissimilarity between the foot and the
hand consists in the difference which the length
of the digits bears to the other components in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
two members. They form nearly <i>half</i> the length
of the hand, but not more than a <i>tenth</i> of that
of the foot. Clearly, therefore, they constitute a
far less important segment of the lower limb than
they do of the upper, and are intended to perform
much less important functions in it. In the
hand the fingers and thumb may be said to constitute
the essential part; whereas the toes do
little more than help the foot to adapt itself to
inequalities of the ground and so to obtain a
firmer holding. In civilized countries, accordingly,
where we walk, chiefly, upon even paths and paved
streets, very little evil results from the loss of the
services of the toes which is incurred by covering
over the foot to protect it against the hardness
of the roads.</p>

<p>We often hear the toes spoken of as ill-treated
members, which are not allowed fair play because
the art of man keeps them in a state of inertness
and deprives them of their natural functions.
Anatomy, too, gives some countenance to the idea,
inasmuch as it shews that the muscles which
minister to the toes are as numerous as those
which are concerned in moving the fingers; and
we occasionally see persons, who, having been born
without hands, or having lost them, contrive to
write and paint and do other unusual offices with
their toes. Watch the movements in an infant’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
foot as yet unshod. They are considerably more
free than in your own; especially you will observe
that there is a power of separating the great
toe from the others and approximating it to them
which you have, probably, altogether lost. The
small size, however, of the toes, and the comparative
fixedness of the inner, or great toe, prove,
that they were never intended for anything like
the same variety of purposes as the fingers, and
shew that, under the most favourable circumstances,
the <i>pes</i> could never be <i>altera manus</i>, as
some would persuade us that it is. Certainly it
was never intended to be an organ of prehension.
Hence, although in practice, boot-makers may
excite our wrath and deserve our condemnation,
I don’t think that, in principle, they are so much
to be complained of.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> striking peculiarity of the human
foot is the size of the inner or <span class="smcap">Great Toe</span> and
the firm manner in which its metatarsal bone is
joined to the other bones, so as to render it a
main pillar of support to the foot. These features
of the great toe have reference to the share of the
weight of the body which is borne by the inner
side of the foot, more particularly during the last
stage of the step, when the body is propelled forwards
over the other foot. Hence it is sometimes
called the “hallux,” from a Greek word (ἅλ-λομαι)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
signifying to bound or spring. The <i>mobility</i>
of the <i>thumb</i>, enabling it to be opposed so easily
to each of the other fingers, is a characteristic of
the human <i>hand</i>; and the <i>solidity</i> of the <i>great toe</i>
is equally, or even more, characteristic of the human
<i>foot</i>. The great toe should be continued,
from the instep, straight along the inner edge of
the <i>foot</i>, or inclined a little <i>in</i>wards; often, as
before mentioned, its phalanges become inclined
<i>out</i>wards so as to interfere with the other toes‍<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>.</p>

<p>Though, in many animals the number of the
toes is the same as in man, this is not the case
in all; and we may trace a gradual and progressive
diminution of the number, in the following
order.</p>

<p>I have said (page <a href="#Page_10">10</a>) that the inner toe is incomplete
in all animals, forasmuch as, in none,
does it possess the same complement of bones as
do the other toes. You will not be surprised to
find, therefore, that it is the first to be missing.
The <span class="smcap">Elephant</span> goes upon <i>five</i> toes; but if you
look closely you will perceive that the inner toe
(fig. 39, <span class="lowercase smcap">I</span>.) has not attained even its usual incomplete
number of bones. It is short of one; and the
inner wedge-bone, which looks like a metacarpal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
bone, is prolonged, downwards, to supply the place,
and to give sufficient length to the toe. The same
thing may be seen in some other animals, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
is interesting as shewing the first indication of departure
from what may be called the standard
number of the phalanges. In the <span class="smcap">Hippopotamus</span>
(fig. 40) we have an additional stage of imperfection
in this same toe; for here there is only one
small bone to remind us of the existence of the toe
(it is the same in the Rhinoceros, <span class="lowercase smcap">I.</span>); all the rest
have failed to be developed; and the animal, consequently,
goes upon <i>four</i> toes. Next the failure
appears on the <i>out</i>er side of the foot, and affects
the little toe. Thus, the <span class="smcap">Rhinoceros</span> (fig. 41)
goes upon <i>three</i> toes—namely, Nos. <span class="lowercase smcap">II.</span> <span class="lowercase smcap">III.</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">IV.</span>—and
there is scarcely a trace either of the first
toe or of the fifth. In Ruminating animals, as the
<span class="smcap">Ox</span> (fig. 42), the second toe is wanting, as well as
the first and the fifth; so that the foot rests upon
<i>two</i> toes (Nos. <span class="lowercase smcap">III.</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">IV.</span>); and in the <span class="smcap">Horse</span> (fig.
43), as we have already seen, only <i>one</i> toe—the
middle one (No. <span class="lowercase smcap">III.</span>)—is developed sufficiently to
reach the ground.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp26" id="f44" style="max-width: 5.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f44.jpg" alt="Leg and foot bones">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_44">44</a>. Gorilla.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Whatever pretensions to Humanity the <span class="smcap">Monkey</span>
may make—and they are sufficiently striking
to render some persons very uncomfortable on the
score of relationship—he is certainly far removed
from us in the construction of the foot (fig. 44);
and the good people to whom I have alluded may
derive consolation from the reflection that, in this
respect at least, there is very little indication of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
cousinship. Indeed we ought not to speak of his
<i>foot</i> at all; for the part which corresponds with the
human foot does not even deserve that name. It
is so much more like a hand, that the term four-handed,
or <i>quadrumanous</i>, is by naturalists applied
to this class of animals. There is scarcely any
plantar arch; the animal bears, chiefly, upon the
outer edge of the foot; the digits are long and
strong; and the inner one, instead of being parallel
with the others, diverges from them so as to constitute
a true <i>thumb</i> instead of a great toe. All these
points are very suitable for enabling the animal to
cling to branches of trees, and for other prehensile
purposes; but they unfit him for the upright posture,
and render it impossible for him to walk
steadily upon his lower limbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<figure class="figleft illowp57" id="f45" style="max-width: 16.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f45.jpg" alt="Drawing of stuffed specimen">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_45">45</a>. Gorilla.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the great ape called the <span class="smcap">Gorilla</span>, which is
found in the south-western part of Africa, and of
which many specimens have now been sent to this
Country, the <i>hind-hand</i> is of great size and strength,
as may be seen in the accompanying drawing made
from a stuffed specimen in the British Museum.
The lower part of the leg is also very thick,
owing to the size of the muscles which move the
great toe and the other digits, and which enable
them to give a most powerful grasp. So strong
and savage is the creature that all efforts to capture
one alive, when full-grown, have, hitherto,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
failed. He is said to give evidence of his strength
of hand and of his amiable propensities in the following
way. He swings by his fore-hands from
the trees, and, letting himself down quietly by
them, watches an opportunity of seizing by the
neck, with his huge hind-hand, some unwary Negro
who may be passing by, draws him up, and holds
him with vice-like grasp, till his struggles have
ceased, and then drops him a strangled corpse to
the ground.</p>

<p>Most of the characters above mentioned as distinctive
of the human foot—such as its compactness
and strength, the height of the plantar arch,
the shortness of the toes—are, like the size of the
calf, most marked in the higher members of the
human family, in those, that is to say, who are
gifted with the highest intelligence. Thus the
formation of the foot is found to have a correspondence
with the formation of the head, and may,
like it, be, to a certain extent, taken, as I have
before remarked, to be an index of intellectual, as
well as of physical, capacity. The relation between
the intellectual power and the physical conformation
of man, which is here exemplified, and which
is maintained throughout the frame, is a subject
of extreme interest, and is one which has not attracted
the attention of anatomists and ethnologists
so much as it deserves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>To what secondary causes this harmonious
adaptation of body to mind may be due, we cannot
clearly tell; but we can see in it a provision
for giving physical ascendancy to superior intellect.
And it is most gratifying to be able to derive,
as we may do, from this as well as from the
observation of the past and the present, the assurance
that the cultivation of the mind, provided
its moral tone be preserved and proper sanitary
precautions be taken, is not likely to be attended
with any deterioration of the body. On the contrary,
we have good reason to believe that the
present civilized nations of the earth, with their
higher mental culture, are inferior to none of their
predecessors in the qualities of the body; surely
soldiers never maintained a hand-to-hand struggle
better than the victors at Inkermann; and we know
that the civilized nations are physically superior
to most of the uncivilized. We have good ground,
therefore, to hope that the extension of education
and commerce will be productive, on the whole, of
an improvement of the physical condition of the
species.</p>

<p>Sir James Emerson Tennent says that the Veddahs,
or aboriginal inhabitants of Ceylon, use the
foot in drawing the bow. They sit down, place
the toe against it, and draw the string with the
hand; and some of the American Indians appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
to have used both feet in the same way. These
Veddahs furnish a good illustration of the low physical
condition which is usually associated with absence
of mental culture. They are described as in
a singularly degraded state. “They have scarcely
any language, no knowledge of God, nor of a future
state, no temples, no idols, no altars, prayers, or
charms; and, in short, no instinct of worship, except
it be some addiction to ceremonies, analogous
to devil worship, to avert storms, lightning, and
sickness. All presented the same characteristics of
wretchedness and dejection—projecting mouths,
prominent teeth, flattened noses, stunted stature,
and other evidences of the physical depravity which
is the usual consequence of hunger and ignorance.
The children were unsightly objects, entirely naked,
with misshapen joints, huge heads, and protuberant
stomachs. The women were the most repulsive
specimens of humanity I have ever seen
in any country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>


<h3><i>The Proportions of the Limbs.</i></h3>

<p>A few years ago I took the measurements of
numerous skeletons which I found in the museums
in France, Germany, and England, and made the
following table to shew the proportions of the
several parts.</p>

<p>The length of the foot and hand is in all somewhat
greater than it should be, in consequence of
the bones composing them being usually less
closely articulated in the artificial skeleton than
they are in nature.</p>

<p>From this it appears that the limbs of <span class="smcap">Man</span>
differ from those of the <span class="smcap">Ape</span>, chiefly, in the proportionate
length of the thigh and arm, and in
the shortness of the foot and hand. And it will
be seen that, in both these particulars, the <span class="smcap">Negro</span>
differs from the <span class="smcap">European</span> and exhibits some approximation
to the <span class="smcap">Ape</span>.</p>

<p>I found, also (the tables shewing this are given
in my work on the Human Skeleton), that these
characteristic proportions of the European are
brought out only during growth; for that in the
early periods of infancy the foot and hand are,
relatively, very long, and the thigh is actually
shorter than either the leg or the foot, and the
arm is shorter than either the forearm or the
hand; and it is only, gradually, during the advance
to manhood, that the proper proportions
are attained. So that the transient or immature
condition of the human frame shews certain resemblances
to the permanent Negro type and to
that of the quadrumanous animals; and these
resemblances become obliterated during further
growth.</p>

<p>The accounts of travellers indicate that some
other nations present great varieties in the proportion
which the length of the foot and hand
bears to the height. Bushmen and Hottentots
are very diminutive, commonly under 5 feet in
height; and their hands and feet are remarkably
small and delicate, in which respect they differ
from Negroes. Mr Bartram observes with regard
to the Cherokees or Muscogulges—a tribe of North
American Indians—that the women are, perhaps,
the smallest race of women yet known, almost all
under 5 ft.; and their hands and feet are not larger
than those of Europeans of 9 or 10 years of age.
He tells us, also, what is very strange, that the
men of this same tribe are of gigantic stature, “a
full size larger than Europeans,” many of them
above, and a few under, 6 ft.; but he says nothing
of the size of their hands and feet. The hands
and feet of the Patagonians are said to be very
small. This may be contrary to what we might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
expect; but it accords with what I found to be
the case in the skeletons of some Giants which I
measured; for in all of them the feet and the
hands were disproportionately short. It would
seem, therefore, that, whether the stature of the
individual be diminutive or gigantic, the foot and
the hand, in either case, are, usually, less than
their proper relative length. A greater number of
accurate data are, however, necessary to enable us
to generalise correctly upon this and other points
of a like nature, or to decide what truth there is
in the common remark, that a long foot in a child
indicates a tall man.</p>

<p>In former times the parts of the human body
were used as measures; and it was not uncommon
to illustrate the tables of measures by drawings
of the human body, with descriptions of the foot,
palm, &amp;c. One of the tables of the 16th century,
derived in great part from the Romans and the
Greeks, is founded upon the notion, which is not
very far from the truth, that in the well proportioned
man, the breadth of the palm is a 24th
part of the whole stature, and the length of
the foot a 6th part, and the length of the cubit—from
the elbow to the end of the fingers—a 4th.
The measures, however, varied at different times
and in different countries, even though the names
were the same. The latter have, in several instances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
remained, though the definite measure
which they now indicate is different from what it
was, and differs from that of the part of the body
from which the name was taken. Thus, our present
foot measure (twelve inches) is considerably
more than the length of the human foot.</p>


<h3><i>The Skin of the Sole.</i></h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Skin</span> of the sole is soft and yet very tough
and strong. It underlies a thick pad of fat, which
separates it from the bones and the plantar ligament.
The fat is interwoven with fibres passing,
through it, from the tissue of the skin to the
bones and ligaments. It is, in this way, rendered
very firm, though it retains much of the soft
quality of fat; and it forms an admirable cushion
for receiving the weight of the body and defending
from injurious pressure both the skin and
the other parts of the foot. The fibres just mentioned
bind the skin to the superjacent bones and
ligaments, and hold it firmly to them, so as to
prevent its being displaced from them in the
movements of the foot upon the ground.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="f46" style="max-width: 24.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f46.jpg" alt="Side view foot bones and sole">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_46">46</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The accompanying woodcut shows that these
connecting fibres are most numerous where there
is the greatest pressure, viz. beneath the heel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
the balls of the toes. It shows, too, that they
take the direction at each of those parts which
is most calculated to prevent displacement. Thus,
at the heel their direction is chiefly from the heel-bone,
backwards, to the skin. When we place the
heel upon the ground in walking, the weight of
the body has a tendency to drive the heel-bone
<i>for</i>wards from the skin; and the direction of the
fibres, from the heel-bone, <i>back</i>wards, just resists
this tendency and holds the skin and the bone
firmly together. On the contrary, when we withdraw
the foot from the ground the pressure is
in the opposite direction, and has a tendency to
drive the metatarsal bones <i>back</i>wards from the
skin. The course of the fibres is, consequently,
changed. They, many of them at least, run <i>for</i>wards
from the bones and prevent the displacement
that would be likely to occur. This direction
is also very marked, and for the same reason,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
at the end of the great toe. A bundle of fibres
radiates from the projecting process, or tubercle,
which is conspicuous upon the under surface of
the bone near its end; and the greater number
of them run <i>for</i>wards, through the pulp of the toe,
to the skin, and maintain the connection of the
skin with the bone when the latter is pressed <i>back</i>wards
in withdrawing the foot from the ground.</p>

<p>The skin of the sole has a peculiar sensitiveness,
which enables it to take quick cognisance
of contact with the ground or of any injurious
substances lying upon the ground. The sensitiveness
in the foot is rather increased by its being
so much covered up. We are aroused to a consciousness
of this sensitiveness when the soles are
tickled, or when any one treads on our toes, especially
if there happen to be a corn there. We
know also how sensitive the feet are to cold, and
how liable we are to catch cold from wet feet.
This sensitiveness renders washing the feet a refreshing
luxury, especially in hot climates or when
we are fatigued. It is a luxury much indulged in
by Eastern nations; “Mephibosheth had neither
dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard from the
day the king departed, until he came again in
peace;” and among the Jews in our Saviour’s
time (Luke vii. 38), when guests were made very
welcome, their sandals were unloosed, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
feet washed and carefully wiped, and, if the person
were of high rank, anointed.</p>

<p>The integument of the foot varies in different
animals, according to the nature of the ground
upon which they tread and other circumstances.
Thus the Elephant, the Hippopotamus, and the
Rhinoceros, living in jungles and in marshy districts,
have a more or less soft covering of skin.
Oxen and Horses gallop about upon dry ground;
and their feet are soled with thick hoofs of horn.
The Dog has tough pads of skin with thick cuticle
upon his feet; and the feet of the Feline tribe
are muffled with fur so as to enable them to approach
their prey with a noiseless tread. Man’s
foot is, by nature, like the rest of the surface
of his body, comparatively unprotected; but as
the foot, by its efficiency, emancipates the hand
from the drudgery of carrying, so does the latter
make some return for this relief by providing
artificial coverings which enable the foot to tread
upon various surfaces, and protect it against the
inclemencies of the seasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>


<h3><i>On Shoes.</i></h3>

<p>A few words on the subject of <span class="smcap">Shoes</span>. No one
will dispute the correctness of the principle that
the shoe should be made to fit the foot; yet it is
not a little remarkable that this principle is so
often departed from in practice, and that the usual
plan is to make the foot adapt itself to the shoe.
That is, the shape of the shoe is determined according
to the fancy of the maker or the dictates
of fashion, and the foot is expected to mould itself
accordingly. This is particularly the case with the
fore part of the shoe, into which the toes, or most
compliant parts of the foot, are squeezed. Thus,
the shape of the sole of a sound foot is about that
represented in fig. 47; the great toe is seen to be
free from the others, and the line of its axis, prolonged
backwards, traverses the centre of the heel.
Compare this with the outline of the sole of a shoe
as usually made; and the violence that is done to
nature is at once perceived. The shoe is made
quite symmetrical, or is curved a little in the part
between the heel and the sole—in the “waist” as
it is called—when the shoes are to be worn on the
left and right foot respectively; and the toes, instead
of being allowed to spread out a little, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
pressed together, and made to converge to a point
in the line of the middle toe, as seen in fig. 48.</p>

<p>The line of the great toe is thus quite altered,
and the other toes are tightly wedged together
(figs. 49 and 50); or, not being able to find room
side by side, they overlap one another and form
unsightly projections beneath the upper leather of
the shoe. No wonder that “corns” and “bunions”
and “in-growing toe-nails” are the frequent result
of this treatment, and that so many persons are
compelled to walk in a cautious, feeling manner,
and to watch the ground narrowly, lest their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
cramped and tender toes come into contact with
a stone or other projecting body.</p>

<p>How greatly to be lamented it is that the foot
should be thus maltreated and distorted, and that
walking should be made so painful, and that the
shoe, which is intended to befriend and protect
the foot, and which, if well fitted, would support
it and preserve its shape, and make some amends
to it for the rough hard roads upon which it is
compelled to tread, should be thus perverted into
a means of galling it and impairing its functions.</p>

<p>This subject has been treated of in a simple
and concise manner by Dr Meyer, Professor of Anatomy
at Zurich, in a small pamphlet, which has
been translated into English by Mr Craig, and entitled,
“<i>Why the Shoe pinches</i>‍<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>.” I hope it may be
read by boot-makers, and may lead to some improvement
in their art. Dr Meyer very properly
remarks that one of the main points to be attended
to is, to allow the great toe to have its normal position;
and this can be done by making the inner
edge of the sole incline <i>in</i>wards, from the balls of
the toes, instead of <i>out</i>wards. The accompanying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
drawing (fig. 51) gives the outline of a shoe designed
under his superintendence, and shows the
difference between it and the usual shape, the latter
being indicated by the dotted outline. In fig. 52
the shoe is pointed, the pointing being effected
from the outer side. I have often laboured, but
laboured in vain, to impress the same point, and
hope the more systematic attempt of Professor
Meyer may lead to better results.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>heel-piece</i>, I have already
said that it should not be high because it makes
the step less steady and secure, and at the same
time shortens it, and impairs the action of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
calf-muscle. A high heel-piece, moreover, renders
the position of the foot upon the ground oblique,
placing the fore part at a lower level than the
heel; thus the weight is thrown too much in
the direction of the toes, and they are driven forwards
and cramped against the upper leather of
the shoe. The high-heel of a boot, therefore, tends
to aggravate the evils which are caused by the insufficient
and ill-adjusted space which is allowed
to the toes.</p>

<p class="mt2em">This account of the foot has necessarily been
very superficial and imperfect. There are many
points in its anatomy to which I have not even
alluded; but, if I have succeeded in giving you
some idea of the general plan of its construction,
and in stimulating you to further enquiry respecting
the mechanism of the Human Frame, my purpose
will have been served. Still more will it
have been so, if you carry away with you some
sense both of the Pride and of the Humility which
the review of such a structure is calculated to excite—of
pride, not selfish pride, but pride resulting
from a consciousness of the nobility of your
physical nature, a pride which will make you spurn
what is bad and degrading, and will help you to
aspire to what is elevated and good. The impressions
resulting from a comparison of this one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
fragment of Nature’s work with our own most
laboured achievements must quell any other pride;
and the very admiration with which we contemplate
the structure of our body impels us to walk
humbly with our God, whose gift that body is.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HUMAN_HAND">THE HUMAN HAND.</h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">THE great characteristic of the Hand, as distinguished
from the Foot, is the mobility of the
first digit, or thumb. Accordingly when this digit
stands out apart from the others, and can be
moved independently of them, so as to be more or
less completely opposed to them, in the upper or
Mammalian Class of animals, at least, we call the
member a Hand. When this digit is absent, or is
fixed in the same manner as the others, which is
the case in each of the four limbs of Quadrupeds,
we call the member a Foot. In Monkeys, or in
most of them, the thumb is present and is separate
and moveable in each of the four limbs; and these
animals are, therefore, called “quadrumanous” or
“four-handed.” Man, having the moveable thumb
upon each of the two upper limbs only, is “bimanous”
or “two-handed.” By this peculiarity, perhaps
more definitely than by any other, he is distinguished
in structure from all the rest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
animal series; and naturalists have, accordingly,
given the epithet “Bimanous” to the class in
which he is placed, and in which he stands alone.</p>

<p>The hand is the executive or essential part of
the upper limb. Without it the limb would be
almost useless. The whole limb is, therefore, so
made as to give play and strength to the hand;
and, in ever so brief a description of the hand, it
is necessary, even more than in the case of the
foot, to give some idea of the manner in which the
other parts of the limb are constructed, and to
dwell a little upon such points as have relation to
its movements.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe25" id="f53">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f53.jpg" alt="Skeleton of arm and hand">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_53">53</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The general plan of construction of the upper
limb will readily be understood by means of the
drawings (figs. 53 and <a href="#f58">58</a>, p. 122). It resembles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
very much that of the lower limb (see fig. <a href="#f04">4</a>, page
15). The one bone of the upper arm—the <i>humerus</i>—resembles
the one bone of the thigh, and is
jointed, above, with the shoulder-blade, which, with
the collar-bone, corresponds with the pelvis. Below,
it is connected with the two bones of the fore-arm—the
<i>radius</i> and <i>ulna</i>; and these correspond
with the two bones of the leg. In the wrist there
are eight bones, called <i>carpal</i> bones, arranged in
two rows. These are connected with five <i>metacarpal</i>
bones; and these, like the metatarsals of the
foot, are jointed with the <i>phalanges</i>. Of the latter
there are three in each finger; but in the thumb,
as in the great toe (page <a href="#Page_10">10</a>), there are only two.</p>

  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_54">54</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The diagram shows how the bones of the hand
are arranged in three divisions. Thus, the upper
row of carpal bones (3, 4, 5) consists, practically,
of three bones; the fourth (6), which is much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
smaller than the others, being rather an appendage
to one of them than a distinct constituent of
the wrist. (According to this view, the number of
the wrist-bones corresponds exactly with that of
the tarsal bones of the foot, viz. 7). The <i>outer</i> of
these three carpal bones (3) bears the thumb‍<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> and
the fore-finger (<span class="lowercase smcap">I.</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">II.</span>), and constitutes, with
them, the outer division of the hand; the inner
one (5) bears the ring-finger and the little finger
(<span class="lowercase smcap">IV.</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">V.</span>), and constitutes the <i>inner</i> division of
the hand; and the middle one (4) bears the middle
finger (<span class="lowercase smcap">III.</span>), and is the <i>middle</i> division of the
hand. The diagram shows, too, that the two outer
bones (3 and 4), with the two outer divisions of
the hand, are connected with the radius; whereas
the inner bone (5) only, with the inner division of
the hand, is connected with the ulna. Strictly
speaking, even this bone is not directly connected
with the ulna, but is separated from it, as will be
shown presently, by a thick ligament.</p>

<p>You frequently hear ignorant persons (and the
greater number of persons are lamentably ignorant
of the structure of their own body) speaking of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
<i>small bones</i> of the shoulder, or the <i>small bones</i> of
the elbow. You may think this a matter of no
importance, and that it does not concern you and
people generally to have any knowledge of human
anatomy. But I will tell you what is very often
happening, and will leave you to judge whether
such complete ignorance on this subject is not attended
with some practical disadvantage. A man
meets with an injury, falls and hurts his shoulder.
The immediate effects of the injury subside; but
he does not quickly recover the use of the part;
he still cannot raise his elbow, or put his hand
upon his head, or put it behind him. Soon he begins
to think that something more is wrong than
has been suspected; and the notion creeps over his
mind, and gradually takes possession of it, that
some small bone is displaced. Not content with
the assurances of his medical man, he resorts to a
quack, called a “bone-setter.” The latter, taking
advantage of the popular fallacy, gratifies the patient
with the information that his fears are correct,
affirms that “a small bone is out,” and proceeds
forthwith to employ the requisite forcible
measures for putting the said “small bone” in. I
need not say with what result. Every year, in
this civilized country, many persons are maimed
for life by these attempts to put imaginary small
bones in. I beg you, therefore, particularly to observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
that <i>there is no small bone</i> either at the
shoulder or at the elbow. The only small bones
are at the wrist; and these are so well fitted to
one another, and so firmly bound together, that
nothing short of a crushing force suffices to displace
them. This remark respecting the small
bones of the wrist is true of nearly all the small
bones in other parts of the body. So that, in fact,
small bones are very rarely dislocated; and when
you hear it asserted that a small bone is out, you
may pretty confidently conclude that the speaker
does not know what he is talking about.</p>

<p>I have said that the upper limbs resemble the
lower in their general construction. There are,
however, some important differences; and one
of the chief of these is the greater variety and
freedom of the movements in the upper limbs.
<i>Strength</i>, for the purpose of carrying the body, is
the object in the lower limbs. <i>Mobility</i> is the
requisite in the upper limbs. Of this one example
has already been given in the instance of the
thumb as compared with the great toe.</p>


<h3><i>Movements at the Shoulder.</i></h3>

<p>An equally striking example is afforded by the
shoulder. In the first place, the “Shoulder-blade”
itself can be moved in several directions—upwards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
downwards, backwards and forwards;—whereas the
“Pelvis,” i. e. the part which bears to the lower
limb the same relation that the shoulder-blade
does to the upper-limb, is immoveably fixed.</p>

<p>Secondly, the “Shoulder-joint” is so made as
to permit a great variety and extensive range of
movements to take place. We can move the arm
forwards or backwards, as in throwing a ball, or,
in sword exercise; we can raise it so that the limb
points straight upwards; and we can swing it
round in any direction. It is owing to the free
movement in this joint that we are able to apply
the hand to every part of the body, so as to remove
sources of irritation. It is interesting to
observe how other animals get on without hands,
though they are much exposed to what we should
consider great annoyance, as from flies, &amp;c. The
Cow, for instance, lashes its hide with its tail.
The Cat licks itself with its tongue. The Sparrow
dusts itself by the road-side. The Pig and the
Donkey roll in the mud. And many of them, as
the Horse and the Ox, have a thin muscle, called
“panniculus carnosus,” spread out under the skin,
which effects those sudden twitchings of the skin
whereby they are enabled to jerk off anything
that troubles them. In Man the hand answers
better than all these methods combined; and it is
necessary that it should do so, because his skin is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
more sensitive and less protected by natural covering
than that of any other animal.</p>

</figure>

<p>For this freedom of movement of the arms,
so important to the usefulness of the hand, we
are much indebted to the “Collar-bones.” These
bones, so called because they are placed at the
lower part of the <i>collum</i> or neck, extend, horizontally,
from the upper edge of the breast-bone,
to the processes of the blade-bones which overhang
the shoulder-joint. Thus they hold the
shoulders apart, and give width to the upper part
of the chest. They also steady the shoulder-blades,
and afford a <i>point d’appui</i> to the muscles which
effect the lateral movements of the arms,—for
instance, to the muscles which tend to draw the
arms together, as when we hold anything, between
the hands, in front of us; and to those which
separate the arms from one another, as when we
stretch them out at right angles with the body.</p>

</figure>

<p>Many animals—the <span class="smcap">Elephant</span>, the <span class="smcap">Rhinoceros</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Horse</span> and the <span class="smcap">Ox</span>—have no collar-bones;
and they are only able to swing their fore
limbs to and fro. They cannot execute any lateral
movements. They cannot throw the limbs
out sideways, nor press their fore feet together,
so as to hold anything between them. If the
horse wants to seize or hold any substance he
must do it with his mouth. The Elephant has
a special provision for the purpose of prehension
in his trunk, which enables him to provide himself
with food by pulling down the branches of
trees. The <span class="smcap">Lion</span> and the <span class="smcap">Tiger</span> can press their
fore paws together sufficiently to enable them to
hold their prey, and fix it upon the ground, while
they put the head down to it and pull at it and
tear it with their teeth; and they are furnished
with rudimentary, or half, collar-bones suspended
in the flesh of the upper part of the chest; while
the little <span class="smcap">Squirrel</span>, which sits upon its hind legs,
and holds up the nuts between its fore paws to be
nibbled, has complete collar-bones. So has the
flying <span class="smcap">Bat</span>, the climbing <span class="smcap">Sloth</span> and the digging
<span class="smcap">Mole</span>. In <span class="smcap">Birds</span> the collar-bones (fig. 56, <span class="lowercase smcap">AA</span>)
are very large; and, for the purpose of giving
them greater strength, they are united together
in the middle line just above the breast-bone,
forming what is commonly called the “merry-thought;”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> 
and, as this is not sufficiently strong
to resist the force of the powerful muscles which
flap the wings and sustain the animal in the air,
there are, in addition, stout “side-bones,” called by
anatomists “coracoid bones.” These (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>) run, from
the breast-bone (<span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>), in the same direction as the
collar-bones, one, on either side, to the shoulder-blades
(<span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>); and they afford even more efficient
support to the shoulders than do the collar-bones.
The coracoid bones are peculiar to oviparous
animals, or nearly so. In some reptiles, as the
<span class="smcap">Crocodile</span>, they quite supersede the collar-bones.</p>

<p>These few examples are enough to show that
freedom of movement of the arms, especially of
lateral movement, is closely associated with, and,
indeed, is dependent upon the shoulder-blades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
being supported and steadied by bones, which extend
from the breast-bone to the shoulder-blades,
and fasten the one to the other.</p>

<p>But, even the powers and advantages conferred
by nature have often some drawbacks; and
this free play of the arm at the shoulder in man,
of which we are speaking, and the provision for it
afforded by the collar-bone, are no exceptions to
the remark. It is necessary for so great a range
of movement that the socket in the shoulder-blade
should be shallow, and that the ligaments which
connect the arm-bone with the blade-bone should
be loose. Hence the shoulder-joint is weak as
regards its ability to resist injury. The collar-bone
also causes the shoulder to project so much
that it is greatly exposed to injury and often
bears the brunt of a fall. A man is thrown from
a horse or is knocked down upon the ground, and,
if anything prevents the hand being stretched out,
the chances are that he falls upon the shoulder.
True, the head is saved thereby; but the shoulder
suffers. Hence the shoulder-joint is more often
dislocated than any other; and no bone is more
frequently broken than the collar-bone. Even in
little children, in whom, notwithstanding their
many tumbles, the other bones usually contrive to
escape, the collar-bones are often broken; and
in grown-up persons the shoulder is sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
dislocated by the mere action of the muscles, as
in swimming, or throwing, or lifting a weight
above the head.</p>

<p>That you may understand the movements of
the shoulder a little more fully, I will ask you to
contrast the drawing (fig. <a href="#f58">58</a>), which shows the
position of the blade-bone upon the chest in Man,
with the drawing (fig. 57) of the corresponding
parts of the Rhinoceros; and you will at once
recognise several important differences, besides
the presence of the collar-bone in the one and
its absence in the other.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe30" id="f57">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f57.jpg" alt="Rhinoceros skull, neck and shoulder girdle">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_57">57</a>. Rhinoceros.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Rhinoceros</span> the chest is deep, from
the back-bone to the breast-bone, and is flattened
at the sides; and the depth of this part of the
trunk is increased, slightly, by the breast-bone
projecting, keel-like, underne1ath, and, much more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
by the spines of the back-bone running up into
a high ridge, above. The blade-bone and the
arm-bone are applied against the flat side of the
chest, and lie, lengthways, between the spine and
the breast-bone, nearly parallel with the broad
flat ribs. The blade-bone has no process overhanging
the shoulder-joint, and, as before said,
there is no collar-bone. The short thick arm-bone
descends nearly in a line with the blade-bone,
and has huge processes at its upper end
for the attachment of muscles. The parts are
designed to bear the great weight of the animal,
and to carry its ponderous head and horn; but
the only movement of which they admit is a
sliding of the blade-bone and arm-bone, backwards
and forwards, upon the side of the chest.</p>

<p>In animals of similar construction to the Rhinoceros,
but of lighter frame, and of greater fleetness,
the blade-bone is placed more obliquely,
which gives freer and easier movement both to it
and to the arm-bone. This, for instance, is the
case with the well-bred horse, and if we want a
quick-going horse, one that can lift his fore feet
well, we should observe whether the shoulder-blade
is oblique, and whether the spines of the back
rise well above it. Such a horse is said to have
“a good shoulder” and to be “well up.” He will
carry a saddle well, and is not likely to trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowe11_25" id="f58">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f58.jpg" alt="Side view of human shoulder, arm and chest">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_58">58</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Man</span> the chest has proportionately less
depth and length, and greater breadth, than in
any other animal; the breast-bone is quite flat;
and the spines of the back are sloped downwards,
so that they do not project beyond the level of
the ribs and the blade-bones. Hence he can lie
easily either upon the stomach or the back—a
privilege which is shared with him by very few of
the lower animals. Scarcely any of them can lie
upon the back, or even upon the stomach without
the help of the fore limbs. The donkey enjoys
rolling over and over upon a dusty road,
but he cannot poise himself for a minute upon
his back.</p>

<p>The sides of Man’s chest, moreover, are not
<i>flat</i>, as in the Rhinoceros and Horse, but <i>rounded</i>,
so that the blade-bones can revolve upon them
to and fro, as well as slide upwards and downwards;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and the long arms—comparatively long,
that is, from the shoulder to the elbow—hang
quite free of the chest and form sharp angles with
the blade-bones.</p>

<p>The blade-bones are accommodated to the
shape of the chest; for, instead of being elongated
in a direction parallel with the ribs, they
are prolonged downwards, along the sides of the
chest, at right angles with the ribs. This prolongation
of the lower part of the blade-bone is
very important, inasmuch as it enables the muscles
to hold the bone steady upon the wall of the
chest, and so gives greater power to those muscles
which pass from the blade-bone to the arm and
act upon the shoulder-joint. Were it not for this
provision the contraction of the muscles intended
to raise the arm would quite fail to produce the
desired effect, and instead of it would simply cause
the shoulder-blade to revolve upon a transverse
axis. That is to say, when we endeavoured to
raise the arm our effort would merely have the
effect of raising the hinder part of the shoulder-blade.</p>

<p>In each of these particulars—in the form of
the chest, and in the shape and direction of the
shoulder-blade—the Monkey is intermediate between
Man and the inferior animals. The Monkey’s
chest is broad and round, in proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
to its length, if we compare it with other animals;
but this is less marked than in the human chest.
And you perceive that the Monkey’s back-bones
project, as they do in other animals, beyond the
level of the ribs. The blade-bones are also like
those of Man in being prolonged downwards, and
in being carried, to a certain extent, across the
ribs; but their lower angles do not run so far
in this direction as they do in the human skeleton.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe20" id="f59">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f59.jpg" alt="Side view of monkey shoulder, arm and chest">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_59">59</a>. Monkey.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The movement of raising the arm, as in carrying
the hand <i>outwards</i>, or pointing upwards, or
putting the hand upon the head, is rather a
difficult one, and requires the combined action of
many muscles. It is, therefore, to be avoided by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
persons to whom muscular straining is likely to
be injurious; and the power of effecting this movement
is easily impaired by accident or disease.
A long time often elapses even after a slight
bruise of the shoulder, before the person recovers
the power of putting the hand upon the head.</p>

<p>The exercise of raising the arms above the
head is a good one for those in health, and is
much, and wisely, recommended by the directors
of gymnastics. It brings many muscles into play,
not only those of the shoulder, but the muscles
all round about the chest, viz. those which pass
from the spine and ribs, as well as from the breast-bone,
head, and pelvis, to the shoulder-blade and
arm; and, thus, it tends to strengthen the spine
and the chest, as well as the shoulders and arms.
There is, perhaps, no exercise so good as this; and
it is much to be regretted that the dress of young
ladies, with its paraphernalia of stays and shoulder-straps,
interferes so greatly with it. The frequency
among them of “pigeon-breast” and “crooked
spine” must, partly, be attributed to the confinement
of the arms, caused by the mode of dress and the
customs of life. One of the few opportunities afforded
to the arms of availing themselves of this
exercise is in the dressing-room during the process
of brushing the hair. I would by all means, therefore,
recommend young ladies to give sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
time and attention to this part of the toilette, and
not to delegate it to the lady’s maid. If, in addition,
I suggest that it be commonly done with
open window, I feel sure that I shall have a deservedly
great authority among them—Miss Nightingale—on
my side.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe7_75" id="f60">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f60.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_60">60</a>.<br>Elbow-joint.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The movement at the <span class="smcap">Elbow</span> is, merely, that
of bending and straightening, in a hinge-like manner;
yet there is a slight obliquity in the direction
in which it takes place, an obliquity resembling
that in the movement at the knee (page <a href="#Page_39">39</a>).</p>


<h3><i>Pronation and Supination of the Hand.</i></h3>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Forearm</span> and <span class="smcap">Hand</span> there is a movement
with which we have nothing exactly corresponding
in the leg. It is called “Pronation and
Supination.” In <i>pronation</i> we turn the palm
<i>down</i>wards, as in picking up any substance from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
a table; in <i>supination</i> we turn the palm <i>up</i>wards,
as a boy does when he holds out his hand for a
caning, or for the more agreeable purpose of having
a shilling put into it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pronation</span> and <span class="smcap">Supination</span> take place in the
following manner. Each of the two bones of the
forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist (fig. <a href="#f53">53</a>);
 but one of them—the “ulna”—is chiefly connected
with the elbow; and the other—the “radius”—is
chiefly connected with the wrist, and, by
means of the wrist, with the hand. The two bones
are separate from one another, except at their
ends. There they touch, and are jointed together
in such a manner that the large lower end of the
radius can play round, or partly round, the small,
button-like, lower end of the ulna; and, in so
doing, it carries the hand with it. In this movement
the upper end of the radius (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>, fig. <a href="#f60">60</a>) does
not leave its place, but simply revolves, upon its
own axis, on the surface of the arm-bone; and its
edge turns in a notch cut for it in the upper end
of the ulna (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>), which remains still.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the drawings (figs. 61 and 62) the relation
of the parts in the supine and in the prone state
is shown by the aid of a plumb-line falling from
the part of the arm-bone upon which the upper
end of the radius revolves. The line traverses the
upper end of the radius, then passes along the interval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
between the two bones, then traverses the
lower end of the ulna, and, finally, takes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
course of the ring finger. And, provided the limb
be held vertically, the line traverses the same
parts whatever be the position of the forearm and
hand. It does so in complete supination, as shown
in fig. 61; it does so in complete pronation, as
shown in fig. 62; and it does so in every intermediate
position. We may call it, therefore, the axis
upon which the radius and the hand turn in pronation
and supination; and, according to this representation,
the ring finger remains stationary during
the movement, while the other fingers and the
thumb perform their partial revolutions around it.</p>

<p>I have said there is no movement in the lower
limb exactly like the pronation and supination of
the forearm and hand. We have, it is true, a
power of moving the leg upon the thigh in a
somewhat similar manner; but this can only be
done when the knee is bent. For instance, when
sitting in a chair with the foot upon a fender, or
with the toes upon the ground, we can make the
foot revolve so as to turn the heel in or out. A
little careful observation, however, will prove that
this movement takes place, altogether, at the knee,
and that <i>both</i> bones of the leg participate equally in
it, the <i>whole</i> leg revolving with the foot. Whereas,
in the case of the forearm, the movement takes
place, partly, at the wrist, and, partly, at the elbow;
and <i>one</i> bone (the ulna) remains <i>still</i> while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
the lower end of the other bone (the radius) revolves
around it. Moreover, the pronation and
supination of the hand and forearm are much more
free than these movements of the foot and leg;
and they take place with equal facility and freedom
in any position of the limb. We can turn the
palm up or down as easily when the elbow is
straight as when it is bent.</p>

<p>The movement of which I am speaking is so
important to the usefulness of the hand, that I
will call your attention to three of the muscles by
which it is effected.</p>

<p>And, let me remark, by the way, that all the
movements in the solid parts of the body—probably
all without exception, even the slight wrinklings
of the skin that take place when it is exposed
to cold—are the result of muscular action.
Muscles are bundles of fibres which have usually a
red colour and constitute what is commonly called
the “flesh” or “lean meat” of animals. They are
endued with the power of contracting or shortening
themselves; and it is this property which
gives rise to the various movements of animal
bodies. At their ends muscles often dwindle into
“tendons” or “sinews” which, though occupying
much less space, and having no contractile power,
are very strong, and serve to connect the muscles
with the bones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>One of the three muscles just mentioned (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>,
fig. <a href="#f61">61</a>) passes from a projecting process on the inner
side of the arm-bone, at its lower end, to the
outer edge of the middle of the radius. Its contraction
causes the radius to roll over, or in front
of, the ulna. It thus pronates the hand, and is
called a “<i>Pronator</i>” muscle. Another muscle (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>,
fig. <a href="#f62">62</a>) passes, from a projecting process on the
outer side of the arm-bone, to the inner edge of
the radius near its upper part. It runs, therefore,
in an opposite direction to the former muscle and
produces an opposite effect, rolling the radius and
the hand back into the position of supination.
Hence it is called a “<i>Supinator</i>” muscle.</p>

  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_63">63</a>. The Biceps Muscle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The third is a very powerful muscle. It is
called the “<i>Biceps</i>” muscle (fig. 63), because it has
<i>two</i> points of attachment to the shoulder-blade.
It descends along the front of the arm, and, bulging
there, forms a conspicuous feature, to which
athletic persons are proud to point in evidence of
their muscular development. Its tendon crosses
over the front of the elbow, and is inserted into
the hinder edge of a stout tubercle which is seen
on the inner side of the radius near its upper end.
The chief effect of this muscle is to bend the
elbow; but it also rotates the radius so as to supinate
the hand; and it gives great power to that
movement. When we turn a screw, or drive a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
gimlet, or draw a cork, we always employ the <i>supinating</i>
movement of the hand for the purpose;
and all screws, gimlets, and implements of the like
kind, are made to turn in a manner suited to that
movement of the right hand, because mechanicians
have observed that we have more power to supinate
the hand than to pronate it, though they are,
probably, not aware that the preponderating influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
of the <i>biceps</i> muscle is the cause of the difference.</p>

<p>The movement of which I am speaking is
performed to its full extent only by Man.
Monkeys cannot completely supinate the hand;
and in most of the lower animals the part
corresponding with the hand remains nearly,
or quite, fixed in a state of pronation. Even in
Man, complete supination is rather a constrained
and awkward position. It is not a position which
is habitual or natural to us. When we see any
one sitting or walking with the palms turned forward
it strikes us as strange, and the idea is suggested
to us that the individual must be strange
too, that, possibly, his head may be a little turned
as well as his hands. In a state of ease the hand
is naturally more or less prone; so that when it is
desired to place the forearm or hand at rest, as in
case of disease or injury, the prone position is
usually selected. If the forearm be broken, for instance,
the surgeon sets the fracture and fixes the
limb with the hand prone or semiprone. This is,
also, the position of greatest strength, as well as of
most ease. Hence, in striking a blow, or carrying
a weight, or making any strong muscular effort,
the palm is always kept more or less inturned.</p>

<h3><i>The Wrist.</i></h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowe20_625" id="f64">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f64.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_64">64</a>. Wrist-joints.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This drawing (fig. 64) represents what is seen
when a section has been made, from side to side,
through the wrist and lower part of the forearm.
It gives an idea of the mode in which the several
bones of the wrist are adapted to one another and
held together by ligaments. The upper three
wrist-bones (<span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">E</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>) are joined together, so as to
present a convex surface, which is received into a
wide cup, or socket, formed by the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
radius (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>) and a ligament passing from the radius
to the ulna (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>); and, in pronation and supination,
the end of the radius, together with this ligament
and the wrist-bones, revolves upon the end of the
ulna.</p>

<p>All the bones here represented are so well fitted
to one another, and so strongly bound together,
that, as I have before said, displacement very
rarely occurs among them. We sometimes <i>hear</i> of
a dislocation of the wrist, but very seldom <i>see</i> one.
The wrist is often bruised, or its ligaments strained,
by falls upon the hand; or, what very often happens,
especially after the middle period of life, the
bones of the forearm are broken a little above the
wrist.</p>

<p>You might think that, in such an accident, the
radius only would suffer, inasmuch as it is especially
connected with the wrist-bones, and so receives
the force directly from the hand. But, if
you observe the line of contact of the radius and
ulna (running from <span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>), you will see that it is oblique,
and that its direction is such as to cause the
ulna to support the radius, and to receive some
of the force from it; and this disposition, which
makes the ulna share the duties of the radius,
makes it, also, share the dangers; hence, it is very
frequently involved with the radius in fracture of
the forearm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>By the joints of the wrist we are enabled to
move the hand backwards and forwards, and also
slightly sideways.</p>


<h3><i>The Movements of the Hand.</i></h3>

<p>I come now to speak more particularly of the
movements that take place in the Hand. I have
already said that the mobility of the thumb is the
chief characteristic of the hand as distinguished
from the foot. Another important distinction between
the hand and the foot is the greater length
and mobility of the fingers as compared with the
toes. The toes are short; and our power of moving
them is, under any circumstances, slight. They
constitute a small, and, comparatively, unimportant,
part of the foot. The fingers, on the contrary,
are long; they form a half, and, including
the thumb, the more important half, of the hand.
Without them the rest of the hand, indeed the
rest of the limb, would be comparatively useless.
Their movements are varied and free, and take
place with singular facility and rapidity. We can
bend them quite down upon the palm, and can
extend them beyond the straight line; we can
separate them from one another to a considerable
extent; and we can bring them together with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
force, as a waiter does when he carries a number
of wine-glasses between his fingers; and persons
who have lost the thumb contrive to hold a pen, a
knife or fork, or other things, between the fingers.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/f65.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_65">65</a>.<br>Muscles of forearm and hand.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let me endeavour to give you an idea of some
of the muscles which are concerned in executing
these movements.</p>

<p>The wrist and hand are bent forwards upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the forearm by means of three muscles (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>,
fig. 65). These all pass downwards from the inner
side of the lower end of the armbone. The outer
and inner ones (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>) are connected, by tendons,
with the wrist-bones; and the tendon of the middle
one (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>) runs over the wrist and becomes spread
out in the palm like a fan, so as to support the
skin of the palm and to protect the nerves and
blood-vessels, which lie beneath it, from injurious
pressure, when we grasp any substance firmly in
the hand. The fan-like expansion of this tendon
in the palm is called the “palmar fascia.” It is
very strong, and is connected, below, with the
ends of the metacarpal bones, and with the sheaths
of the fingers. The bundle of muscles near <span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>
forms what is called the “ball of the thumb,”
and serves to move the thumb in various directions.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowe8_875" id="f66">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f66.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_66">66</a>.<br>Muscles and tendons of hand.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Beneath these three muscles which bend the
wrist and strengthen the palm lies another set of
muscles (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>, fig. 66) which bend the thumb and
fingers. They pass from the bones of the forearm,
and end in long tendons or “leaders”
which run over the wrist and palm and along
the fingers and are firmly connected with the
last phalanges of the fingers. They lie close to
the bones in their whole course, and are held
in their places by sinewy cross bands and sheaths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
which are seen, both at the wrist and in the
fingers, in fig. 65.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe8_75" id="f67">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f67.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_67">67</a>.<br>Muscles and tendons on back of forearm and hand.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fig. 67 represents the muscles on the back
of the forearm. The tendons pass from them,
and run, some to the wrist and extend, or bend
backwards, the wrist upon the forearm, some
to the thumb and extend the several joints of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
the thumb; and others run to the back of the
fingers. These leaders lie nearer to the skin
than do those on the palmar aspect; and most
of those which go to the thumb and fingers may
be distinguished through the skin. The short
muscles (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>) situated upon and between the
metacarpal bones pass from them to the sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
of the fingers; some of these serve to spread
the fingers out from one another, while others
have the effect of drawing them together. There
are several such small muscles on both surfaces
of the hand, but I must not detain you by a
description of them; and there are other little
muscles passing from the flexor tendons to the
phalanges, which have been called <i>fidicinales</i>,
from their assisting in performing the short
quick motions of the fingers, and from their
being, accordingly, called into action in playing
upon the violin and other musical instruments.</p>


<h3><i>Movements of the Thumb.</i></h3>

<p>In its adaptation to the purposes of bearing
the weight and ministering to the locomotion
of the body the human foot excels that of any
other animal; and, unquestionably, the human
hand is not less preeminently distinguished by
the nicety, the variety, and the freedom of its
movements. This is shown by the manner in
which it can be twisted about, by the exquisite
play of the fingers; and it is shown, above all,
by the mode in which the thumb can be moved
to and fro, can be opposed to the other fingers,
and to any part of them individually and collectively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
and can be folded beneath them or
clasped upon them as occasion may require.</p>

<p>The power which the thumb possesses, and
gives to the hand, is signified by its name—“pollex,”—derived
from the Latin word <i>pollere</i>,
which means to have power. Some have supposed
that the word “poltroon” is derived from
<i>pollice truncato</i>, and signifies one so cowardly
that he has submitted to have his thumb cut
off in order that he may be incapacitated for
fighting.</p>

<p>The faculty which we possess of moving the
thumb in the way I have mentioned, athwart
the other fingers, and of touching any part of
the palmar surface of either of them depends,
partly, upon its being set, not quite in the
same plane with them, but, obliquely, so that
when it is moved towards the palm it faces or
opposes the other fingers; and, partly, upon the
nature of the joint between its metacarpal bone
and the bone of the wrist with which it is connected.</p>

<p>This joint is so constructed as to admit of
three different movements. <i>First</i>, the thumb can
be moved forwards or backwards, that is, towards,
or, away from, the palm. <i>Secondly</i>, it can be
“adducted” or “abducted,” that is, approximated
to the forefinger or inclined away from it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
<i>Thirdly</i>, it can be “circumducted,” that is, its
extremity can be made to describe a circle, as
in “twiddling the thumbs.” These several movements
are effected with great power and rapidity
by means of the bundle of muscles which forms
the “ball of the thumb” (fig. <a href="#f65">65</a>. <span class="lowercase smcap">D</span>), as well
as by the long muscles and tendons which descend,
from the forearm, to the thumb.</p>


<h3><i>Movements of the metacarpal bones of the
Fingers upon the Wrist.</i></h3>

<p>The movements of the thumb, through the
medium of its metacarpal bone, upon the wrist
are much more free than those of any of the
other fingers. The middle finger, indeed, has its
metacarpal bone set upon the wrist so fixedly
as to admit of scarcely any such movement. The
forefinger can be thus moved a little; the ring
finger more and the little finger still more.</p>

<p>You may easily prove this by taking the
knuckles or heads of the respective metacarpal
bones of one hand between the fingers and
thumb of the other hand, when you will find
that you can press the knuckle of the little
finger backwards and forwards in a very perceptible
manner. Then try the knuckle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
ring finger; the movement is distinct, though
not so free as in the case of the little finger.
The knuckle of the forefinger you will find to
be almost fixed; and in that of the middle finger
you will be unable to perceive any movement at
all.</p>

<p>In fact the joints of the metacarpal bones of
the fingers with the wrist resemble those of the
outer four toes with the tarsus; and the drawings
of these joints of the foot (figs. <a href="#f22">22</a> to 25)
will serve sufficiently well to illustrate those of
the hand.</p>

<p>These movements of the metacarpal, or knuckle,
bones upon the wrist enable us to increase or
diminish the hollow of the palm by bringing
its edges more or less forward. Thus, when we
make a cup of the hand we bring forward the
metacarpal bones of the thumb and the little
finger, wrinkling the skin of the palm; and
when we spread the hand open we carry those
bones backwards, rendering the skin of the palm
tense.</p>

<p>These movements, moreover, enable us to
bring the little fingers and the thumb more easily
into contact.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what advantage is
gained by the fingers and thumb all differing
from one another in length; or don’t you take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the trouble to reflect upon little matters of this
sort? If you have, I would ask you now to remark
that there is, in the several fingers, a relation
between their shortness, their position near
the edge of the hand, and the amount of mobility
of their metacarpal bones upon the wrist. Thus
the finger which is in the middle of the hand is
the longest, and its metacarpal is the most fixed.
The fore-finger is not quite so long; and its metacarpal
is rather less immovable. The ring-finger
comes next in shortness and in the mobility of
its metacarpal. Then the little finger; and the
thumb which is much shorter than any other has
also its metacarpal much more moveable.</p>

<figure class="figright illowe13_75" id="f68">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f68.jpg" alt="Hand position holding a ball">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_68">68</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Observe, further, that, when the fingers and
thumb are separated from one another, and then
bent, the middle knuckle-bone remains stationary,
but the others are advanced a little forwards, each
to an extent proportionate to its mobility upon
the wrist, and to the shortness of the finger. The
fore-finger is, by this means, advanced a little,
the ring and the little fingers more, and the
thumb most of all. And the result is, that the
tips of the fingers and the thumb come all to a
level, and form, with the palm, a great hollow in
which we can grasp any substance, a cricket-ball,
for instance, and hold it very firmly. The length
of the several fingers and the thumb is, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
just so regulated, in relation to their mobility
upon the wrist, as to give us this power.</p>

<p>You may observe, also, that when the fingers
and the thumb are spread out the space between
the thumb and the fore-finger is considerably
greater than either of the spaces between the other
fingers. Then, by a slight movement, the thumb
takes up a position in front of, or opposite to,
the fingers; and in grasping any substance it
has to antagonise the pressure exerted by all
the fingers. Hence it needs to be much stronger
than they are, and to be wielded by more
numerous and more powerful muscles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Middle Finger</span> is not only the longest
and the largest finger; it is also, to a certain
extent, the centre about which the others move.
Thus, when the fingers are bent down into the
palm, their tips all converge towards the middle
finger; and when they are spread out, they all
diverge from it. Its greater length and the
greater prominence of its knuckle, expose this
finger to injury more than any of the others;
which may account for the fact that Surgeons
are called upon to amputate the middle finger
more frequently than either of the other fingers
or the thumb.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fore-finger</span> has the greatest range of independent
movement. Hence it is used to point
with, and is called the “Index” or “Indicator”
finger.</p>


<h3><i>Writing.</i></h3>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Writing</span> the pen should be held between
the pulps of the fore and middle fingers and the
thumb, in contact with all three, and firmly lodged
between them. The down-stroke is made by bending
the phalanges of the fingers and the thumb
inwards and the metacarpal bone of the thumb
outwards; and the up-stroke is made by straightening
all the joints of the fingers and thumb.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
The hand rests lightly, not upon its whole
edge, but, upon the hindermost and foremost
parts of the edge, that is, upon the pisiform
bone of the wrist and upon the little finger near
the end, so that it can be moved easily along the
paper, and can be inclined, or rolled, a little to
either side. The obliquity of the stroke is not
imposed by mere arbitrary rule, but is in accordance
with the direction in which there is the freest
movement of the fingers and thumb when thus
holding the pen. Make the experiment for yourselves
of moving the pen in different directions,
and you will soon be satisfied that the writing-master
has nature on his side in insisting on a
particular movement as well as a particular mode
of holding the pen. Some persons make the
strokes vertical, or slope them the wrong way;
but in either case the writing is stiff and awkward;
it is not natural.</p>

<p>The custom of writing from left to right may
also be regarded as correct or natural, inasmuch
as we can move the pen more freely upwards and
<i>out</i>wards than upwards and <i>in</i>wards. Hence the
light <i>up</i> or advancing stroke—that which connects
a letter with the one which follows it—is most
easily made <i>out</i>wards or to the right; and the letters
are, consequently, made to follow one another
in that direction. To understand this more clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
make a down-stroke upon paper in the usual
manner; you will then find that you can make
up-strokes from any part of it more easily to the
right than to the left; and if you make a series of
continuous up-and-down-strokes at a little distance
from one another, the up-stroke is, not
merely habitually, but naturally, made fine and
inclined to the right, whereas the down-stroke
is made heavier or thicker and is sloped to the
left. Moreover, you will perceive that the hand
slides along the paper more easily from left to
right than from right to left.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that the writing of all
that great class of languages called Indo-European,
which includes Sanscrit, Greek, Latin, and many
others, with our own, is from left to right; whereas
nearly all the writing of another great class called
the Semitic, which includes the Hebrew and Arabic,
is in the opposite direction, viz. from right to
left. Some nations write in perpendicular columns,
the letters being placed under one another, of
which the Chinese affords an example. But either
of the two latter methods must be inferior to the
Indo-European style in ease of execution and expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>


<h3><i>Reason for the Ring being usually placed upon the
Fourth finger.</i></h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ring-finger</span> has less independent movement
than either of the others. It cannot be bent
or straightened much without being accompanied
by one or both of those next it. This is, partly,
because its extensor tendon is connected, by means
of a band of fibres, with the tendon on either side
of it. You may discern these connecting bands
working up and down under the skin of the back
of your hand when you move the fingers to and fro
(they are represented in fig. <a href="#f67">67</a>). The ring-finger
is, therefore, always, more or less, protected by the
other fingers; and it owes to this circumstance a
comparative immunity from injury, as well, probably,
as the privilege of being especially selected
to bear the ring in matrimony. The left hand is
chosen for a similar reason; a ring placed upon it
being less likely to be damaged than it would be
upon the right hand.</p>

<p>Other reasons have been given for this preference.
It has been attributed to a notion among
the ancients that the ring-finger is connected with
the heart by means of some particular nerve or
vessel, which renders it a more favourable medium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
than the other fingers for the reception and transmission
of sympathetic impressions; the left hand
being selected, in preference to the right, because
it lies rather nearer to the heart.</p>

<figure class="figright illowe9_75" id="f69">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f69.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_69">69</a>.<br>Nerves of hand.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>Some slight foundation for such a notion might
be imagined to exist in the fact (supposing the ancients
to have been acquainted with it) that the
distribution of the nerves to the ring-finger is
rather peculiar. The peculiarity will be readily
understood by reference to the accompanying
drawing (fig. 69). Two chief nerves are seen descending,
in their course from the brain, along the
arm and forearm, to supply sensation to the palmar
surface of the hand. One (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>), the larger of the
two, passes in front of the middle of the wrist, and
divides into branches which are distributed to the
skin of the thumb, of the fore and middle fingers,
and of the <i>out</i>er side of the ring-finger. The other
nerve (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>) lies on the <i>in</i>ner side of the forearm and
wrist, and its branches go to the skin of the little
finger, and of the inner side of the ring-finger.
You see, therefore, that there is, in this finger, a
meeting of the branches of the two nerves; the
two sides of the finger being supplied by different
nerves. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose
that it gains any superiority in sensitiveness
or sympathetic relations by this arrangement; and
this distribution of the nerves certainly does not
offer so probable an explanation of the selection of
that finger for the honourable office of ring-bearer
as the one I have suggested.</p>

<p>I must remark, here, that the nerve (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>), in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
passing from the arm to the forearm, lies on the
inner side of the back of the elbow, and is popularly
known by the misnomer of the “funny-bone‍<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>.”
It lies, pretty much out of harm’s way, in a well-protected
channel between two bones. Nevertheless,
it is now and then hurt; and you know that
when the “funny-bone” is struck, a peculiar pain,
or tingling, is experienced along the little finger
and the adjacent side of the ring-finger.</p>

<p>The practice of wearing rings upon the hand is
a very ancient one. In some instances they were
badges of slavery. More generally they were marks
of high esteem or authority; as when “Pharaoh
took off his ring from his hand and put it upon
Joseph’s hand,” and when “Ahasuerus took off his
ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it
to Mordecai.” The Roman knights also wore rings
of gold. Sometimes rings were worn as charms
against diseases; a practice which has been revived
in our own day. They were placed upon any of
the fingers, and upon the right hand as well as
the left. Thus we read in Jeremiah, “though
Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were
the signet upon my right hand.” The preference
of the left hand and of the ring-finger seems to be
comparatively modern, originating, probably, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
the ring was made lighter and more fragile, and
was, at the same time, adorned with precious
stones, and when it became, therefore, desirable
to place it upon the part of the hand where it is
least exposed to injury.</p>


<h3><i>The Monkey’s Hand.</i></h3>

<p>Most of you have spent some time in watching
the inmates of that interesting part of a zoological
collection, the <span class="smcap">Monkeys’</span> cage, and have observed
how nearly the hand of that animal resembles the
human hand, in the presence of a thumb, in the
variety and celerity of its movements, in the facility
with which it can catch and pick up objects
and hold them up to the mouth, and in some other
points. A little closer observation, however, will
show that there are some differences between the
two. The several parts do not bear the same relation
to one another in the Monkey’s hand which
they do in the human hand; neither have they quite
so great variety or range of movement. The hand
is altogether narrower, and straighter. The thumb
is shorter and less strong, scarcely reaching beyond
the knuckle of the fore-finger. The fingers, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
contrary, are longer and of more uniform length;
they do not admit of being separated so widely
from each other in a fan-like manner; and the
metacarpal bones at the edges of the hand, i. e.
the metacarpal bones of the thumb and of the ring
and little fingers, have not the same amount of
play upon the wrist. Hence the thumb and the
fingers of the Monkey cannot be opposed to one
another so easily as in man; neither can they be
so advanced in front of the middle finger as to
form a hollow or cup, in the way I described when
speaking of the hollow of the palm and the different
lengths of the fingers in the Human hand.
When you throw a Monkey a nut he usually picks
it up and holds it between the thumb and the <i>side</i>
of the bent fore-finger, not between the tips of the
thumb and fingers. The length of the fingers
adapts the Monkey’s hand well for clasping firmly
the branches of trees, and assisting the animal to
climb about in its native forests, or to hold on to
the bars of its cage; and so the part answers the
requirements of the creature better than if these
qualities had been sacrificed to a greater regard
for variety and range of movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>


<h3><i>The Hand the Organ of the Will.</i></h3>

<p>The human hand is peculiarly an organ devoted
to the will, being more directly and completely
under its influence than is any other part
of the body. The <span class="smcap">Will</span>, remember, is that self-directing
faculty which can be said to exist, definitely
and decidedly, in Man alone, which is
associated in him with the responsibility attaching
to the selection between good and evil, and
which is given to him to fit him to be the reasonable
servant of his Maker, and upon which, therefore,
his dignity, and his capability for occupying
a position between the low animal and the
high spiritual world, so much depend. How appropriate
is it, then, that the will should have
a special organ assigned as its more peculiar
minister. It is to the complete subjection of
the hand to the will, no less than to the combination
of strength with variety and delicacy in
its movements, that Man is indebted for his dominion
over the rest of the animal world, and for
the ability to execute the wonderful works which
his genius designs.</p>

<p>When we reflect how essential is the hand
to Man’s well-being, power, and progress, and upon
the infinite variety of purposes which it serves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
in obedience to the will, we are not surprised that
the construction of the foot, indeed of every part
of the frame, should have reference to the object
of liberating the hand from the subordinate work
of locomotion to a degree which we find in no
other animal, and of leaving it free to execute
its higher offices in a ready and efficient manner.</p>

<p>But, after all, notwithstanding the excellence
of its mechanism and its intimate relation to the
will, what would the hand be without the reflecting
and designing <span class="smcap">Mind</span>—the mind that can build
upon the past and prepare for the future, and so
carry on the ever-advancing work of human civilization
and progress. Without it Man would remain
stationary, like the other animals; and, as
age succeeded age, the hand would only suffice
to provide the necessary requirements of the body.
Nay, even this is saying too much; for without
the mind, without, at least, some higher instinctive
or reflective faculty than the other animals
possess, Man would, in reality, be inferior to them.
He would be absolutely unable to maintain his
existence, and would be a miserable victim to
the fineness of his organisation. His hand would
fail to supply him with food, or to defend him
against his numerous enemies, or to provide for
the protection of his delicate and sensitive frame
from the inclemency of the elements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>The real excellence of the human hand—and
the remark applies equally to the whole human
body—consists, not in the admirable construction
of its several parts, nor in their well-adjusted
relation to one another, so much as in the adaptation
of the whole to the mind that presides over
it. This it is that renders Man the lord of the
creation, that enables him to subdue all his foes,
and gives him, in some measure, power over the
elements, so that land and water, fire and air,
are made to serve his purpose. By this harmonious
co-aptation of mind and body Man is rendered
cosmopolitan, being able to thrive in every
clime, from the regions of continual snow to those
burning equatorial plains where even reptiles
perish from the heat and drought, and being able
to convert the barren plain into a fertile field,
and to draw water out of the stony rock.</p>

<p>At the late meeting of the British Association
at Oxford, a gentleman related that he had a
monkey which was very partial to oysters, and
was very fond of playing with a hammer; but
he never could be taught to use the hammer for
the purpose of breaking the oyster-shells to gratify
his appetite. How wide a gulf does the
absence of intelligence in this simple matter indicate
between ourselves and the animal that
approaches nearest to us!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>


<h3><i>The Hand an Organ of Expression.</i></h3>

<p>Further, we cannot fail to recognise and admire
the adaptation of the hand to the mind at
all ages, and under various circumstances; in its
weakness and suppleness, and in its purposeless
and playful movements in infancy and childhood;
in its gradually increasing strength and steadiness
as the intellect ripens; in the stiffness and shakiness
of declining years; in the iron grasp of the
artizan; in the light delicate touch of the lady;
in the twirlings, fumblings, and contortions of the
idiot; in the stealthy movements of the thief; in
the tremulousness of the drunkard; in the open-handedness
of the liberal man; and in the close-fistedness
of the niggard.</p>

<p>Thus the hand becomes an organ of expression
and an index of character. What would the
nervous young gentleman in a morning call give
to be quit of these tale-telling members; or what
would he do without a hat or a stick to employ
and amuse them? How effective an auxiliary to
the orator is the wave of the hand, or, even, the
movement of a finger. Some men, indeed, seem
to owe the efficiency of their declamations as
much to the hand as to the tongue. I have seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
a practised orator (he was a man of the most complete
self-possession) quell an excited audience by
one determined movement of his hand. It happened
to me to hear two of the most celebrated
preachers of the day within a short period. In
each of them the movements of the hand were
remarkable, though very different. In one, the
free, impassioned, but natural, and, therefore, easy
action of the hand showed a deep and genuine
interest in the subject, and helped to waft the
fervid sentiments straight from his own heart to
the hearts of his audience. In the other, who was
a no less accomplished speaker, the constrained
and carefully regulated movements of the hands
were evidently the result of forethought and
study; they were intended to be impressive, but
were too obviously done for effect; and, therefore,
were far less effective as well as less pleasing.</p>

<p>Our great and venerable orator, as well as high
authority on the art of speaking (Lord Brougham),
tells us that the subject of a speech should be
carefully studied, and the sequences well adjusted.
He says that, in the most effective passages, even
of practised speakers, the exact words are usually
selected beforehand; but he is silent respecting
the actions by which they should be accompanied.
These, at least, should be unpremeditated; and
they will best assist to convey to others the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
feelings and emotions when they are the simple
result of the natural working of the mind upon
the body.</p>

<p>The kind of expression that lies in the hand,
being much dependent on the effect of the
muscles upon it, is very hard for the artist to
catch, though very important to the excellence
of the picture. Painters, usually, make the hand
a subject of careful study, but rarely succeed in
throwing the proper amount, either of animation
or of listlessness, into it. In portraits, especially,
the hands are a difficult part to treat satisfactorily;
yet the artist feels that they are too important
not to have a prominent place, and he,
commonly, imposes upon himself the task of representing
them both in full. I have seen them
drawn held up in front, like the paws of a
kangaroo, in an otherwise good picture. The
stereotyped position in portraits is that one hand
lies upon a table, though it, probably, evinces
an uneasiness there, while the other rests, perhaps
equally uneasily, upon the arm of a chair.
Vandyck, in whose paintings the hand usually
forms a prominent feature, is considered to have
peculiarly excelled in imparting to it a sentimental
air imbued with deep pathos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>


<h3><i>Shaking Hands.</i></h3>

<p>How much do we learn of a man by his
“<span class="lowercase smcap">SHAKE-OF-HAND</span>.” Who would expect to get
a handsome donation, or a donation at all, from
one who puts out two fingers to be shaken and
keeps the others bent as upon an “itching palm”?
How different is the impression conveyed by the
hand which is coldly held out to be shaken and
slips away again as soon as decently may be,
and the hand which comes boldly and warmly
forward and unwillingly relinquishes its hearty
grasp? Sometimes one’s hand finds itself comfortably
enclosed, nursed, as it were, between both
hands of a friend, an elderly friend probably; or
it is shaken from side to side in a peculiar short
brisk manner. In either case we are instinctively
convinced that we have to do with a warm and
kindly heart. In a momentary squeeze of the
hand how much of the heart often oozes through
the fingers; and who that ever experienced it
has forgotten the feeling conveyed by the eloquent
pressure of the hand of a dying friend,
when the tongue has ceased to speak?</p>

<p>Why do we shake hands? It is a very old-fashioned
way of indicating friendship. Jehu
said to Jehonadab, “Is thine heart right as my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
heart is with thine heart? If it be, give me
thine hand.” It is not merely an old-fashioned
custom; it is a strictly <i>natural</i> one, and, as
usual in such cases, we may find a physiological
reason, if we will only take the pains to search
for it. The Animals cultivate friendship by the
sense of touch, as well as by the senses of smell,
hearing, and sight; and for this purpose they
employ the most sensitive parts of their bodies.
They rub their noses together, or they lick one
another with their tongues. Now, the hand is
a part of the human body in which the sense of
touch is highly developed; and, after the manner
of the animals, we not only like to see and
hear our friend (we do not usually smell him,
though Isaac, when his eyes were dim, resorted
to this sense as a means of recognition), we,
also, touch him, and promote the kindly feelings
by the contact and reciprocal pressure of the
sensitive hands.</p>

<p>Observe, too, how this principle is illustrated
by another of our modes of greeting. When we
wish to determine whether a substance be perfectly
smooth and are not quite satisfied with
the information conveyed by the fingers, we
apply it to the <span class="lowercase smcap">LIPS</span> and rub it gently upon them.
We do so, because we know by experience that
the sense of touch is more acutely developed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the lips than in the hands. Accordingly, when
we wish to reciprocate the warmer feelings we
are not content with the contact of the hands,
and we bring the lips into the service. A <span class="lowercase smcap">SHAKE-OF-HANDS</span>
suffices for friendship, in undemonstrative
England at least; but a <span class="lowercase smcap">KISS</span> is the token
of a more tender affection.</p>

<p>Possibly it occurs to you that the <span class="smcap">Tongue</span> is
more sensitive than either the hands or the lips.
You have observed that it will detect an inequality
of surface that escapes them both, and that minute,
indeed, is the flaw in a tooth which eludes its
searching touch. You are right. The sense of
touch is more exquisite in the tongue than in any
other part of the body; and to carry out my theory,
it may be suggested that the tongue should be
used for the purposes of which we are speaking.
It is so by some of the lower animals. But, in
man, this organ has work enough to do in the cultivation
and expression of friendship in its own
peculiar way; and there are obvious objections to
the employment of it in a more direct manner for
this purpose.</p>

<h3><i>The Skin of the Hand.</i></h3>

<p>By the aid of the accompanying drawings you
will be able to form some idea of the structure of
the <span class="lowercase smcap">SKIN</span> of the hand.</p>

<figure class="figright illowe21_875" id="f70">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f70.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_70">70</a>. Skin.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of them (fig. 70) represents a section of
the skin, made perpendicular to the surface, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
seen under the microscope. It is from the end of
the thumb, and includes three of those delicate
lines, or ridges that are found there.</p>

<p>The superficial, or uppermost strata (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>),
are the “Cuticle” or “false skin.” The outer layer
(<i>a</i>) is hard, horny, and dry. It is composed of
numerous fine scales laid upon one another, like
the tiles upon the roof of a house, but adhering
more closely together, so as to form one continuous
sheet extending all over the body. The outermost
of these scales are continually being shed, peeling
off as scurf, or being rubbed off; and fresh ones are
supplied by the next layer (<i>b</i>), which is a softer
material and lies immediately upon the surface of
the “cutis” or “true skin.”</p>

<p>This softer layer (<i>b</i>) is often called the “<i>Rete
Mucosum</i>.” It is made up of minute bags or bladders,
named “cells” by anatomists, which grow
and propagate upon the exterior of the true skin,
being nourished by the blood in the skin. Those
which lie nearest the cutis are the youngest and
the softest. Gradually they are pushed outwards
by their successors or offspring; and, as they approach
the surface, they become flatter and drier
and more adherent to one another, and are finally
converted into the thin scales of the cuticle. Thus,
there is no real line of division between the cuticle
and the rete mucosum; but the cells of the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
are gradually transformed into the scales of the
former.</p>

<p>The rete mucosum is thicker in the Negro than
in the white man, and contributes somewhat to the
softness of his skin. It contains also the colouring
matter in the form of minute black particles diffused
among its cells (fig. <a href="#f72">72</a>). These particles disappear,
more or less, as the cells become changed
into scales; hence the outer part of the cuticle of
the Negro is not so dark as the rete mucosum,
but, as it is transparent, or nearly so, it allows the
dark colour of the rete to show through it.</p>

<p>Persons commonly speak of the cuticle as if it
were the whole thickness of the skin. Thus, when
a blister has drawn, they say the <i>skin</i> is raised;
whereas it is only the <i>cuticle</i>. This is forced off
from the skin by the fluid effused into its softer
layer—i. e. into the rete—in consequence of the
irritating influence of the blister.</p>

<p>The cuticle has no nerves, and, therefore, no
feeling. It may be cut or torn without pain. The
snipping of a blister with the scissors is not felt,
because the cuticle only is touched. It forms a
covering to the whole surface of the body, and
is invaluable as a means of preventing too great
evaporation. Without it we should be dried up,
almost mummified, by the end of a summer’s day.
It also protects the delicate sensitive skin underneath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
How sore is the knuckle when the cuticle
has been rubbed off! The cuticle has, moreover,
the accommodating property of becoming thickest
where it is most wanted, as on the sole of the foot,
and on the palms of the hands of blacksmiths, and
artizans, and persons who handle the oar. And if
any other part of the body be subjected to much
friction, for instance, the knees of housemaids, or
the shoulders of men who carry packs, the cuticle
soon becomes thickened there.</p>

<p>Beneath the cuticle lies the “Cutis” or “True
Skin” (<i>c</i>, fig. <a href="#f70">70</a>, and <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, fig. <a href="#f71">71</a>). It is a
tough structure consisting of interlacing fibrous
and fine muscular tissue, and contains the blood-vessels
and nerves. The cuticle may be pared off
without any bleeding; but directly the skin is
wounded the blood flows. The cutis does not present
an even surface next the cuticle, but shoots
out into a number of little finger-like processes,
called “Papillæ,” which project into the contiguous
soft stratum of the cuticle, and are embedded in
it. Thus the superficies of the skin is increased;
and as the blood-vessels and nerves of the cutis
are continued into the papillæ, they contribute
very greatly to the sensitiveness of the skin. They
are most numerous in parts where the sensitiveness
of the skin is greatest; for instance, they are
more numerous on the palmar, than on the dorsal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
surface of the hand. Near the ends of the fingers
and thumb they are arranged in a linear manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
forming the delicate ridges that encircle the cones
of the pulps. Sections of these ridges are represented
in fig. <a href="#f70">70</a>.</p>

<p>The superficial or papillary part of the cutis
is of finer and more delicate structure than the
deeper or fibrous layer, and is, therefore, sometimes
described as a separate layer. It is so represented
in the accompanying figure (71, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p>As we are upon the subject of the cuticle and
the papillæ, I will take the opportunity to say a
word respecting two diseases of these structures,
in which most of you, probably, have a personal
interest. I mean “Warts” and “Corns.”</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="table">
<div class="row">

  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_74">74</a>. Wart.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Wart</span> (fig. 74) depends chiefly on a diseased
state of the papillary stratum of the skin. The
papillæ become coarse and grow up beyond the
level of the surrounding skin, so as to present an
uneven or “warty” surface. They carry a layer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
cuticle before them. This layer is usually thin, so
that the wart bleeds easily when it is rubbed.
Sometimes, however, it is very thick and hard like
a piece of horn. We, now and then, hear of a horn
growing upon some part of the body, perhaps on
the forehead. Such a horn is, usually, nothing
more than a conical mass of cuticle formed upon
the surface of a large wart. Warts are generally
caused by something irritating the skin, as dirt or
soot rubbed into the cuticle. For this reason they
are more frequent upon the hands than upon other
parts of the body.</p>

<p>In a <span class="smcap">Corn</span> (fig. 73), also, the papillæ are somewhat
enlarged; and this accounts in part for the
great tenderness of corns. But the primary and
essential feature of a corn is a thickened state of
the cuticle. This is caused by too great rapidity
in its formation, and is, usually, dependent upon
pressure, especially if the pressure be combined
with some friction. Hence corns are most commonly
found upon the foot, and upon the parts of
the foot, where the skin is subject to pressure and
rubbing against the shoe. The drawing shows the
appearance presented by a vertical section through
a corn and through a small portion of the skin on
either side. The accumulated layers of cuticle are
seen, and the enlarged papillæ shooting up into
them. I need scarcely add that it is owing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
ignorance, or something worse, when corn-cutters
talk of curing the malady by taking out the
<i>roots</i>; for, corns, evidently, have no roots.</p>

<p>One word of advice about corn-cutting. Most
persons have some experience in this art, and
some opportunity of practising it on themselves;
and many pride themselves on their skill in it.
The usual plan is to shave off layer after layer
from the whole surface of the corn; and this, by
lessening the projection of the corn, may give
relief for a few days, though it does not always
do that. Soon, however, the distress returns;
and the area of the corn increases after each
operation. Now, I would have you observe that
it is at the <i>middle</i> of the corn that the papillæ
are most enlarged; and it is here that the formation
of cuticle goes on most quickly, giving
rise to the little white cone or cones often seen
in a corn and sometimes wrongly called the roots.
The proper mode is to confine the cutting to this
part, and to remove as much of the thickened
cuticle as you can from this spot, digging, as it
were, a hole in the middle and leaving the circumference
intact. The circumference, which is
not usually tender, thus forms a wall round the excavated
centre and defends it from pressure; and
great relief is experienced. Further benefit will
be found from covering the corn with some soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
adhesive plaster; and you may sometimes, with
advantage, lightly apply common caustic before
putting on the plaster. If you follow these directions
carefully you may be your own chiropodists,
and almost defy your bootmakers.</p>

<p>If, in cutting a corn, you go too deeply, you
will wound the tops of the papillæ and cause some
bleeding; this is not however usually followed
by any ill consequences.</p>


<h3><i>Nails.</i></h3>

<p>Almost all vegetable as well as animal surfaces
are covered with some kind of cuticle. It
forms the smooth exterior of a leaf and the
rind of an apple; and the soft down of a moth
or a butterfly, the scales of fish, the feathers
and claws of birds, the quills of the porcupine,
the horns of oxen and the hoofs of the horse
are examples of modifications of cuticle. <span class="lowercase smcap">NAILS</span>
and <span class="lowercase smcap">HAIR</span> are also of this nature. They are both
continuous with the cuticle, and peel off with it
when it is, by any process, separated from the
skin. Both are formed, like the cuticle, of compressed
plates or scales matted together; and
these are continually being shed or rubbed off
on the one side, and supplied from the rete mucosum
on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>The rete mucosum, it should be stated, extends
over the whole surface of the body. In
most situations, as already mentioned, it is the
medium from which the ordinary cuticle is produced;
but on the upper part of the ends of the
fingers and toes it is converted into nail, and in
the hair follicles, as I will presently describe, it
is transformed into hair.</p>

<figure class="figright illowe15_375" id="f75-77">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f75-77.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Figs. 75, 76, 77.<br>Longitudinal sections of Nail.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The drawings will help you to understand the
relation of the nails to the cuticle and the cutis.
In the upper of the three (fig. 75) the nail with
the cuticle has been detached from the cutis, so
that the continuity of the two, at either end,
is shown. In the middle one (fig. 76) it is represented
lying in its bed in the cutis; its thin
hinder edge being received into a furrow made
for it in the cutis. The layer of rete mucosum
(<i>b</i>) extends behind and beneath it, between it (<i>d</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
and the cutis (<i>c</i>), and continually adds fresh
material to the nail, just as, in other parts, it
adds to the substance of the cuticle. The cuticle,
or white line (<i>a</i>) is continuous with the nail at
the sides as well as at either end. The lower
figure (77) shows the bed of the cutis in which
the nail reposes, the nail as well as the adjacent
cuticle and the rete having been cleared away.</p>

<p>Thus the addition from the rete—in other
words the growth of the nail—takes place at
the hinder edge and at the under surface. In
consequence of the addition from <i>behind</i> the nail
is increased in length and is pushed forward;
and as it advances forwards it receives accessions
from <i>beneath</i>, which increase its thickness and
strength. Unless they be cut, or worn down,
the nails grow to an indefinite length; and,
when they extend beyond the tips of the fingers,
their edges are bent in towards each other, and
they become curved like claws. This tendency to
a convex form is shown also if the nails be not
properly supported by the pulps of the fingers.
For instance, when persons become emaciated
the pulps of the fingers usually participate in
the general wasting and the nails become curved.
Hence this shape of the nails has been regarded
as an indication of consumption. You will understand,
however, from what I have said that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
is not really a symptom of any one particular
disease. It simply indicates that, from some
cause or other, the nutrition of the body is not
properly maintained.</p>

<p>The Dervishes in some parts of Asia allow the
thumb-nail to grow long, and then pare it to a
point, so as to be able to write with it. Dr Wolff,
the Eastern traveller, has told me that he has
repeatedly seen this done, and that he has in his
possession manuscripts written in this way.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe22_5" id="f78">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f78.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_78">78</a>. <br>Transverse section of Nail Rete and Cutis.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Beneath the nail the cutis is disposed in a
series of parallel ridges (fig. 78) with intervening
furrows. These take the same direction as the
nail, and, indeed, give rise to the fine lines that
you see upon the surface of the nail. The rete
mucosum, or deep soft layer of the nail, extends
into the furrows between the ridges, just as the
soft stratum of the cuticle extends between the
papillæ of the cutis. It thus serves to keep the
nail steady in its place, while it permits a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
amount of movement, and allows the nail to slide
forwards upon the skin under the pressure caused
by the growth at its hinder edge.</p>

<p>A little in front of the root of the nail the
ridges of the cutis suddenly become larger and
more vascular. This gives a pink hue to the nail
in the greater part of its extent; while the hinder
portion, separated from the front by a crescentic
line, is white, in consequence of the subjacent
cutis being there, more pale. You will, at once,
recognise the distinction between these parts by
looking at your own nails.</p>

<p>The ridges and furrows serve, like the papillæ
in other parts of the skin, to increase the surface
of the cutis; and, by affording more space for the
distribution of the vessels and nerves, they contribute
to the sensitiveness of the part, and account
for the severe pain which is caused when
any foreign body is thrust under the nail. The
pulp in the interior of a tooth, and the frog of a
horse’s foot, are also instances in which an exquisitely
sensitive structure is placed beneath a hard
or horny substance. The object, in each case, is
the same, viz. to give the power of taking cognizance
of impressions which are made upon the
surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>


<h3><i>Hairs.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Hairs</span> may also be regarded as modifications
of the cuticle, because, like the nails, they are continuous
with the cuticle, and are formed from
the rete mucosum. Each hair (figs. 79 and <a href="#f83">83</a>) is
received into a depression of the cutis, which is
called a “follicle,” and which is lined, as far as the
bottom, by cuticle (<i>a</i>), and rete mucosum (<i>b</i>). At
the bottom of the follicle (<i>d</i>) the cuticle is absent,
and the hair rests, directly, upon the rete; and, at
this part, the rete, instead of being converted into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
cuticle, as it is at the sides of the follicle, becomes
transformed into hair, in the following way.</p>

</table>
</div>

<p>The cells of which the rete is composed swell
out as they ascend, and so form the soft “bulb” of
the hair. The outermost cells are gradually flattened,
and assume an imbricated arrangement,
overlapping one another like the tiles upon a
roof (fig. 79, <i>e</i>, and fig. 80); and those in the interior
are elongated, so as to be converted into
more or less distinct fibres. The cells nearest the
middle, or axis, of the hair remain moister and
softer than those nearer the exterior, and form
what is sometimes called the “marrow” of the
hair (figs. 81 and 82).</p>

<p>The colour of the hair is given by the presence
of minute grains of colouring matter, like those in
the cuticle of the Negro. They are formed in the
cells at the root of the hair, and pass up with them
into its structure. The quantity of colouring matter
is usually slight in infancy and childhood, and
increases during adolescence. Hence the hair becomes
darker as we grow up. It is more or less
deficient in the grey hair of old age; and in the
instance of Marie Antoinette, and others whose
hair is said to have turned grey in a few hours,
the colouring matter is supposed to have been destroyed
by some fluid, formed from the blood, and
passing, through the pulp, into the hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>The hairs serve to protect the skin; and, as a
general rule, they are most abundant upon the
parts which are most exposed, and which, therefore,
stand most in need of such protection. They
are scattered over the back of the hand. On the
palmar surface they are not required, and they
would have interfered with the sense of touch; and
we do not, accordingly, find them there, nor upon
the sole of the foot, nor upon the edges of the lips.
In certain parts of some animals, however, they
serve as valuable adjuncts to the tactile organs by
extending the range within which the contact of
surrounding substances is felt. Thus the whiskers
of the cat are set upon papillæ so sensitive that
the slightest touch upon any part of the hair is
felt; and the animal is thereby assisted in threading
its way in the dark. This provision, added to
the mode in which their feet are muffled with soft
hair and their claws are retracted, enables the
members of the feline tribe to steal with almost
absolute stillness upon their prey.</p>


<h3><i>Oil-glands.</i></h3>

<figure class="figright illowe11_25" id="f83">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f83.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_83">83</a>.<br>Hair, and Oil-glands.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are also in the skin a number of little
<span class="smcap">Glands</span>. One set of these are called “oil-glands;”
for their office is to furnish an oily, or waxy, substance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
which serves to keep the skin soft and pliable,
and defends it against too much moisture, or
too great dryness of the atmosphere. They are
usually, as shown in the accompanying sketch, (fig.
83, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>) connected with the hairs, lying beside them;
and their ducts—the little tubes that carry off the
oily matter formed in them—open either into the
hair follicles, or penetrate the cuticle at some other
part. They are not found on the palms of the hand
or the soles of the feet, because those parts are, in
great measure, sheltered from atmospheric influences,
and are well moistened with perspiration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
When the dry easterly winds prevail one is disposed
to wish that these glands were more numerous
on the back of the hands; for a more liberal
supply of their secretion would, probably, prevent
the disagreeable chapping to which we are subject
at those times. As a substitute we resort to some
unctuous matter, such as glycerine, which if frequently
applied in small quantities performs, to
some extent, the part of the natural secretion in
keeping the cuticle soft and supple, and so preventing
its cracking.</p>

<p>The secretion of these glands has an odour, the
purpose of which, in man, is not very obvious. It
is faintest in the highest and most civilized nations.
In none is it very agreeable; and persons
are fain to conceal it by substituting some other
odour, as that of lavender or eau-de-cologne. Unfortunately
the choice is not always so refined;
and one is, sometimes, disposed to think that the
natural odour must be very bad, if the substitute
be preferable. The odour varies at different parts
of the body; it varies also in different persons,
sufficiently to enable the acute nose of the dog to
track one particular man among a thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>


<h3><i>Sweat-glands.</i></h3>

<p>To revert to the figure (<a href="#f70">70</a>) at page 165, the
little masses at <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, are grains of fat lying in the
meshes of the deeper strata of the skin, or in the
structure just below it. And the little balls of
twisted tube (<i>f</i>, <i>f</i>) are <span class="smcap">Glands</span> that secrete the
<span class="smcap">Perspiration</span>; for, the perspiration does not ooze
up from the whole surface of the skin, but has a
regular system of factories for its formation. A
fine tube (<i>h</i>) is seen passing from each of these
“sweat-glands,” as they are called. It curls in a
spiral manner, like a cork-screw, where it traverses
the cuticle to open at the surface. On the palmar
aspect of the hand most of these tubes or ducts
open along the tops of the fine ridges which are
there seen; and with a magnifying glass of moderate
power you can distinguish their orifices on the
flattened tops of the ridges on your own fingers.
These are the “pores of the skin,” respecting which
we hear so much, and through which the Roman
Bath brings such streams from the subjacent
glands.</p>

<p>The sweat-glands are scattered all over the
body, but are especially numerous in the palm
and in the sole; and the moisture issuing from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
them tends to keep the skin of these parts soft
and moist, and so fitted for the reception of tactile
impressions. The quantity of fluid furnished by
them varies a good deal in different persons, and
under different circumstances. In some persons it
is habitually slight; and the hands feel dry and
harsh. Or, what is equally disagreeable, it is superabundant;
and the hands are habitually damp,
perhaps, cold and clammy, staining the gloves and
soiling everything they touch. In fever the perspiration
is defective; and the dryness and heat of
the palm are often the first symptoms of an accession
of fever that attract the patient’s notice.</p>

<p>We all know that perspiration is usually increased
by exercise, or by the application of warmth
to the surface, as by the hot air in the sudatorium
of the Roman Bath; and then, by its evaporation, it
cools and relieves the body, and contributes to our
comfort. We know, too, that it is liable to be
increased by any thing that produces a depressing
effect, and that it then induces an uncomfortable
sensation, chilling the surface too much, and making
it cold and clammy. Most of you have experienced
the discomfort of the cold sweat caused by
fright; and some of you may have felt the cold,
clammy hand of one who was suffering under the
shock of a severe accident or the prostration caused
by the sudden onset of a dangerous malady. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
perspiration should occur under these very different
conditions, producing, at one time, so much
relief, and, at another, so much additional discomfort,
it is not easy to say.</p>


<h3><i>The sense of Feeling and of Touch in the Hand.</i></h3>

<p>I have mentioned three parts of the body as
remarkable for the acuteness of the sense of touch,
namely, the <span class="smcap">Tongue</span>, the <span class="smcap">Lips</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Hands</span>.
Now in each of these the skin is richly supplied
with nerves and blood-vessels; and it is also thick
and lies upon a soft cushiony substance, so as to
be yielding and to admit of being applied accurately
over any surface with which it is placed in
contact, and of again resuming its shape when the
pressure is removed. For instance, the tongue is
so soft and yielding that, when it is applied to a
tooth, it dips down between the inequalities and
coves accurate information of the condition of the
whole surface. The same is the case with the
edges of the lips, though not in so marked a degree
as in the tongue; and each of these parts is
indebted for its great sensitiveness very much to
the delicate soft supple nature of its structure.
The palmar surface of the hand too, though, like
the skin of the sole, it is strong and tough, so as
to offer considerable resistance to injury and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
prove no dainty morsel even to dogs, as we surmise
from the narrative of the death of Jezebel, is
yet very soft and yielding. It is also underlaid by
a stratum of fat interwoven with strong fibres of
tissue, just in the same manner as the skin of the
sole of the foot (fig. <a href="#f46">46</a>, p. 99).</p>

<p>An accumulation of this fat and fibrous tissue
under the skin forms the “Pulps” at the ends of
the fingers. The slightly conical form and exquisite
softness of the Pulps adapts them well for the
examination of the surfaces of bodies; and the
sense of touch is more acute in them than in other
parts of the hand.</p>

<figure class="figright illowe5" id="f84">
  <img class="w100" src="images/f84.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Fig. <a href="#fignote_84">84</a>.<br>Bones of Finger.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In connection with them it is interesting to
observe that the last bone of each finger and of
the thumb swells out, at the end, into a nodulated
lump, which serves the purpose both of supporting
the pulp and of giving breadth to the nail. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
also, like the corresponding part of the toe (page <a href="#Page_99">99</a>),
affords a basis of attachment for the fibres
that run, from the bone, through the pad of fat, to
the skin, and give firmness and consistence to the
part. The bulbous enlargement at the ends of the
phalanges of the fingers and toes is peculiar, or
almost peculiar, to man. In most Animals these
bones taper to a point; in many they are also
curved. Hence the nails are, in them, comparatively
unsupported, and they become bent in at
the sides and curved in their length, that is to say,
they are formed into claws. This is the case, to a
considerable extent, in the Monkey. The terminal
phalanges of the monkey’s digits are more
tapering than in man; the nails are more claw-like;
and the pulps are less well-formed. This
constitutes a not unimportant feature of difference
between the hand of that animal and the
human hand, in addition to those I have already
mentioned.</p>

<p>You have experienced the sensitiveness to cold
of the pulps of the fingers and toes; and have,
probably, remarked that it is more difficult to
keep them warm than any part of the body. I
may add that, notwithstanding the liberal allowance
of the means of supporting life (that is, blood
and nervous influence) which they enjoy, they are
very liable to mortify from frost-bite and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
causes. I have repeatedly known that to happen
when all the rest of the hand has escaped. This
must be attributed, perhaps entirely, to their exposed
position as terminal parts; and they share
their susceptibility to cold with other parts similarly
circumstanced, such as the nose, the elbows,
the knees and the buttocks.</p>

<p>It is necessary to make a distinction between
the <span class="smcap">Sense of Touch</span> and common <span class="smcap">Feeling</span> or
sensitiveness to pain; for they are not quite the
same. They are, it is true, very nearly alike, so
nearly that we may consider them to be modifications
of one another; and it is probable that the
same nerves minister to both. Still there is a
difference. The sense of touch is the sense of
contact with <i>ex</i>ternal bodies, and enables us to
take cognisance of their presence and inform ourselves
of their shape, consistence, smoothness or
roughness, &amp;c.; whereas common sensation, or
the sense of feeling, has an <i>in</i>ternal relation. It
imparts to us information respecting the condition
of our own bodies or any part of them. By
the sense of touch in the tongue, for instance,
we judge of the size and hardness of the morsel
in the mouth; and by common sensation we learn
that the organ is being bruised or scratched by
it. Sensation of pain commonly destroys the sense
of touch. Put your finger into a vice, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
may feel both sides of it. Screw it up, and you
have nothing but the sensation of pain. If you
were to awake in this state you would not, from
the mere sensation, know that you were <i>touching</i>
anything.</p>

<p>As a general rule there is a relation between
the degree in which sensation and the sense of
touch are manifested in different parts of the
body. For instance, I have just been remarking
on the acuteness of the sense of touch in the
Tongue; and we know that this part is very
sensitive to pain. The pain caused by a bite of
the tongue is horrible; and so effectually does it
serve the good end of warning the tongue to
keep within its proper bounds, that that organ
very rarely suffers from the pressure of the teeth.</p>

<p>But, forasmuch as sensitiveness to pain serves
a different purpose from the sense of touch,
namely, as in the instance of the tongue just
mentioned, it renders parts alive to injurious impressions,
and gives them warning to escape or
protect themselves; so it is, as we might expect,
most manifested in those surfaces where a slight
amount of injury would prove most detrimental.</p>

<p>Thus, the membrane (the conjunctiva) which
lines the eyelids and covers the front of the eyeball
is exquisitely sensitive to pain. We are reminded
of this when anything touches the eye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
or when a fly has lodged itself under the eyelid.
And, when an operator wishes to ascertain whether
his patient is sufficiently under the influence
of chloroform he separates the eyelids and puts
his finger gently upon the eye, knowing that if no
indication be given, by flinching, that the impression
made here is felt, it is probable that the
patient will not be conscious of the more severe
impression to be made by the knife elsewhere.
Yet, this membrane is by no means pre-eminently
endued with the sense of touch. Indeed, the
very acuteness of its sensitiveness to pain quite
unfits it for distinguishing the quality of the impressions
made upon it. We know very quickly
that something is in contact with the eye, but
can form no idea what kind of substance it is,
whether it be hard or soft, rough or smooth.</p>

<p>In the hand, on the contrary, the sensitiveness
to pain, though considerable, is not proportionate
to the acuteness of the sense of touch.
The sting of the rod on the palm, if my recollection
serves me right, is not so sharply felt as it
is upon that other region which shares with the
hand the privilege of receiving the wrathful attentions
of the master; and, yet, that other
region is by no means distinguished for acuteness
in the sense of touch.</p>

<p>The mode in which sensitiveness to touch and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
to pain are adjusted in the hand and in the eye in
relation to the functions of these two organs is one
of the admirable features of their construction.
Suppose the disposition to have been reversed—suppose
the hand to have been as tender as the
eye—of what use would it have been? The
contact of a particle of dust would have caused
agony; or, had the eye been no more sentient
than the hand, it would soon have been destroyed
by the chafing of foreign bodies upon its delicate
surface.</p>

<p>How important is the sense of Feeling! more
important than any of the other senses; more so
than all the others taken together. It is almost
universal in the animal kingdom. Indeed, we
can scarcely conceive animal existence without it,
and are slow to admit that to be an animal which
shows no sign of it. Several of the lower animals
seem to be destitute of any of the other
senses. The <span class="smcap">Polyps</span>, for instance, have no sight,
hearing, taste, or smell, and are dependent, therefore,
entirely, upon feeling for their communication
with the external world; and the range of
this sense is extended in them by means of their
“tentacles” or “feelers” which wave about in
the water, and, when they come in contact with
foreign bodies, close upon them and draw them
towards the oral opening. Thus, the tentacle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
the polyp is a sort of rudimentary hand, and, by
the aid of feeling, fulfils one important function
of the hand, viz. that of the supplying the mouth
with food. The sprawling movements of an infant’s
hands and the tendency which they have
to close upon anything—dress, blanket, or whatever
it be—and draw it to the mouth remind
one forcibly of the feelers of a polyp.</p>

<p>In most of the lower animals, however, the
sense of feeling, though present, serving for protection
and giving notice of injury, is not very
acute. It is not much employed by them for
the purpose of obtaining information respecting
external objects; and they can scarcely be said
to enjoy that modification of it which we call the
sense of touch in any high degree. Indeed, the
skins of animals have, commonly, such a covering
of thick, horny cuticle, scales, feathers, or hair,
as is incompatible with a fine discriminating sense
of touch.</p>

<p>In many of them, however, some other sense
is highly developed. The <span class="smcap">Vulture</span> is guided by
the smell of carrion for miles and miles; and the
dog will, by the same sense, track game where
man cannot detect the trace of an odour. Some
birds can distinguish objects which are quite out
of the range of our sight. The <span class="smcap">Eagle</span>, for instance,
soars aloft, till it dwindles to a mere speck or is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
lost to our view, and, then, from that great height,
will pounce, with unerring certainty, on an unhappy
grouse upon the ground. The sense of hearing
is a great means of protection to animals, and
necessitates extreme stillness and caution on the
part of their pursuers. The <span class="smcap">Deer</span>, when feeding,
directs his eyes upon the ground, and depends for
safety, chiefly, upon his hearing, which is so acute
that the huntsman is obliged to approach with all
possible wariness.</p>

<p>In each of these instances, it may be observed,
the acuteness of the particular sense is manifested
chiefly in the power it gives to the animal of distinguishing
objects <i>at a distance</i>. Whereas, in the
ability to use the several senses for the nice discernment
of the <i>qualities</i> of substances and to derive
enjoyment from them, man stands quite unrivalled.
He alone appreciates the perfume of a
bouquet, or takes cognisance of the various shades
of colour and of the notes of music; and the sense
of touch, which is of especial service in aiding us
to an accurate knowledge of bodies, is much more
highly developed in man than in other animals.</p>

<p>Fine as the sense of touch usually is in the
human hand, it becomes far more so when an unusual
demand is made upon it in consequence of
a deficiency, or absence, of other senses. The
rapidity with which blind persons can read with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
their fingers is truly astonishing. Some are said
to be able to distinguish colours by the feel. (It
should rather be said that they are capable of recognising
the nice differences in certain substances
by which colours are caused; for one can scarcely
conceive it possible to distinguish by feeling the
colours in a ray of light separated by a prism.) I
am acquainted with a lady who has been, not only
blind, but deaf and dumb from infancy. The
sense of touch is, therefore, almost her only avenue
for impressions from without; and it is surprising
how much information is conveyed through it, and
how quickly. It enables her to hold converse with
her relatives, by the language of the fingers, almost
as freely and as briskly as others do with
the tongue. A few touches are sufficient to transmit
a series of thoughts. After one shake of the
hand her friends told me that she would recognise
me again; and, true enough, although several days
elapsed before I again saw her, she made the sign
for my name as soon as she touched my hand.
At our next meeting I presented my left hand,
but was, again, immediately recognised.</p>

<p>Persons who have had much experience in the
instruction of the deaf and dumb find that the
hand, by means of writing and “dactylogy”, or the
language of finger-signs, is abundantly sufficient
for all the intercourse to which a deaf-mute is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
equal; and they are, therefore, disposed to discourage
the teaching of articulation. Dr Kitto, in
his little book “On the Lost Senses,” which acquires
so much interest from the fact of his being
himself deaf and dumb in consequence of an accident,
relates that, after he had, with great difficulty,
reacquired considerable facility of speech,
he found it stood him in little stead. So efficient
a means of intercourse had the hand become that,
he tells us, he had not occasion for the use of his
tongue ten times in a year.</p>

<p>Not only may the hand thus serve, to some
extent, as a substitute for some of the other
senses; it is also a most important auxiliary to
them. Particularly is it so to the sense of sight, by
proving, or correcting, the impressions which we
receive through the eye. Without its aid we
should often fail to distinguish between a real
object and a picture or a reflection in a mirror,
and should have difficulty in judging of size,
shape, distance, &amp;c.</p>


<h3><i>Relation of the Hand to the Eye and the Mouth.</i></h3>

<p>You cannot have watched a game of cricket
without being struck by the manner in which
the hand acts in harmony with the eye. With
what almost lightning-like rapidity it is in the exact
place to catch the ball; and with what precision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the practised cricketer can throw the ball to
a great distance. In this, however, he is surpassed
by the wonderful skill with which the Indian
throws the lasso. Again, it is enough for the
sportsman merely to get sight of the bird; he is
scarcely conscious of the process by which the
hand directs the gun and pulls the trigger at the
exact moment. Still more remarkable is the successful
aim when taken, as it occasionally is, without
bringing the gun to the shoulder.</p>

<p>In estimating the importance of the hand, you
must not forget that the mouth is quite dependent
upon it for supplies. In most other animals the
jaws are prolonged, forwards, from the cranium,
and the head is placed in such a position that the
mouth becomes an organ of prehension, and is
enabled to provide for itself. But, in man, the
head is carried so high above the ground, and the
jaws are so shortened and compressed beneath the
forehead, that the mouth is of little use in obtaining
food. Its abilities and duties are restricted to
receiving, masticating, and swallowing; and, if it
had to rely upon its own efforts for supplies of
food, it would, indeed, be in a poor case. When
we look at one of the Sphinxes from Egypt, or at
one of the stately Bulls from Nineveh, in which
wisdom and power are represented by joining a
human head to the trunk and limbs of an animal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the question suggests itself, “How is that mouth
to be fed?” In the Centaur and Mermaid this difficulty
is overcome by adding the hands, as well
as the human head, to the trunk and locomotory
organs of the horse in the one instance, and the
fish in the other; so that monstrosity does not preclude
the means of sustentation. Sufficient incongruities,
however, still remain to justify the exclamation</p>

<p class="ml2em fs90 ti0">“Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici?”</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Elephant</span> the mouth is circumstanced,
somewhat, as in man; and the office of feeder is
performed by the elongated snout or proboscis.
This organ, with its finger-like extremity, is so
sensitive and mobile as to be able to pick up small
bodies—pins or needles—from the ground, and so
strong as to pull down large branches of trees, and
gather the fruit from them. It is interesting, in
connection with the relation of the hand to the
will and the intellectual endowments, to remark
that this proboscidean substitute, which fulfils so
many of the purposes of the hand, is furnished to
the “half reasoning” elephant. The natural sagacity
and teachableness of this creature, of
which such interesting evidence is given in Sir
Emerson Tennent’s book on Ceylon, seem to render
it quite worthy of the privilege of having an
especial organ provided to minister to its will.</p>

<h3><i>Cheiromancy.</i></h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Beauty</span> of the hand does not come in for
quite so great a share of admiration as that of the
foot. Perhaps, because we are less often gratified
with the view of the latter. Perhaps, because we
are conscious that the foot is even more decidedly
characteristic of the human form than is the hand;
inasmuch as the hand of the monkey approaches
more nearly to the human hand than does the
foot of any animal to the human foot. Still, we
are by no means insensible to the charms of a
pretty hand; and we prefer that the glove which
envelopes it should be of a material as thin and
pliable as kid, so that it may adapt itself accurately
to the part, and not conceal its form. A
small and delicate hand is thought to be one of
the best signs of high-breeding. Thus, Byron, who
was no bad judge of such matters, writes</p>

<p class="ml2em fs90 ti0">
“Even to the delicacy of her hand<br>
There was resemblance such as true blood bears,”
</p>

<p class="ti0">and again,</p>

<p class="ml2em fs90 ti0">
“Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers<br>
No lips ere left their transitory trace.”
</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lines</span> upon the palm, or creases formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
in closing the hand, differ a little in different persons.
In former times, when men were addicted
to the arts of divination, and thought more about
the connection between the physical world and
the world of spirits, and strove, by a close observation
of the former, to penetrate the mysteries
of the latter, much attention was paid to these
lines. They were named with the names of the
Planets and the signs of the Zodiac; and a science
grew up akin to Astrology and Physiognomy.
<span class="smcap">Cheiromancy</span> was the name given to it; and numerous
and voluminous treatises were written upon
it. We are told that Homer was the author of a
complete essay upon the lines of the hand. That
something of the kind was practised among the
Romans we learn from a passage in Juvenal, translated,
somewhat freely, by Dryden, as follows:</p>

<p class="ml2em fs90 ti0">
“The middle sort, who have not much to spare,<br>
To cheiromancer’s cheaper art repair,<br>
Who claps the pretty palm to make the lines more fair.”
</p>

<p>You will estimate the value of the science of
<span class="smcap">Cheiromancy</span> when you hear that equal furrows
upon the lower joint of the thumb argue riches
and possessions; but a line surrounding the middle
joint portends hanging. The nails, also, came in
for their share of attention: and we are informed
that, when short, they imply goodness; when long
and narrow, steadiness but dulness; when curved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
rapacity. Black spots upon them are unlucky;
white are fortunate. Even at the present day
Gipsies practise the art when they can find sufficient
credulity to encourage them.</p>

<p>Whether any fancy of the like kind gave
origin to the notion still prevalent that a wound
or injury between the thumb and the fore-finger
is peculiarly likely to be followed by <span class="smcap">Lock-jaw</span>,
or whether the notion was grounded on some
notable instance in which that fearful malady
did actually supervene upon a wound in the
situation mentioned, I cannot tell. You may,
however, rest assured, that it is quite a fallacy.
Lock-jaw may result from a wound in any part
of the body, or it may occur without a wound;
it is very capricious in its attack; the surgeon
does not know when to look for it; it often
shows itself when he least expects it; but it is
not more likely to follow a wound between the
thumb and the fore-finger than a wound elsewhere.
I think it well to mention this, because
I have often known persons greatly alarmed when
they have accidentally cut themselves in the
dreaded spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>


<h3><i>Cause of the preferential use of the Right Hand.</i></h3>

<p>Why is man usually <span class="lowercase smcap">RIGHT-HANDED</span>? Many
attempts have been made to answer this question;
but it has never been done quite satisfactorily;
and I do not think that a clear and distinct
explanation of the fact can be given.</p>

<p>There is no anatomical reason for it with
which we are acquainted. The only peculiarity
that we can discern is a slight difference in the
disposition, within the chest, between the blood-vessels
which supply the right and the left arms.
This, however, is quite insufficient to account for
the disparity between the two limbs. Moreover,
the same disposition is observed in left-handed
persons, and in some of the lower animals; and
in none of the latter is there that difference between
the two limbs which is so general among
men.</p>

<p>Is the superiority of the right hand real and
natural, that is, congenital? or is it merely acquired?
I incline much to the latter view; because
all men are not right-handed; some are
left-handed; some are ambidextrous; and in all
persons, I believe, the left hand may be trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
to as great expertness and strength as the right‍<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>.
It is so in those who have been deprived of their
right hand in early life; and most persons can do
certain things with the left hand better than with
the right.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though I think the superiority
of the right hand is acquired and is a result
of its more frequent use, the tendency to use it,
in preference to the left, is so universal that it
would seem to be natural. I am driven, therefore,
to the rather nice distinction, that, though
the superiority is acquired, the tendency to acquire
the superiority is natural.</p>

<p>It may be argued that the tendency must be
based upon something physical, and that, therefore,
a tendency to superiority implies an actual
superiority. This may be so; but I do not think
that we are quite in a position to assert that it
is so. We perceive that there is a tendency to
the preferential use of the right hand; but we do
not know upon what that tendency depends, and
have, therefore no right to assert that the cause of
it lies in the construction of the limb or of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
parts which supply the limb with blood and nervous
influence, or, indeed, upon any strictly physical
cause whatever.</p>

<p>It may be a tendency like that of certain
animals to make their holes and nests in particular
places and in particular ways, to watch for
their prey at particular spots, to migrate in certain
directions at particular periods, and to group
themselves in a particular order during their travels.
Such tendencies, or “Instincts” as they are
often called, may possibly be the result of a peculiar
conformation of the several animals; but it
is, at present, by no means certain that they
are so.</p>

<p>I have said that man is the only animal in
whom a preference in the use of the limb or
limbs of one side is shown. This is a consequence
of the fact that he is the only animal who
has occasion to use the limbs of the two sides
separately, or who is in the habit of doing so.
Even in the rudest state of society this habit is
engendered in him from a very early period, as
in carrying a stick, throwing a spear, and in a
variety of ways. The habit increases as he becomes
more civilized, owing to the greater number
of offices which the hands are called upon to
perform; and the necessity for using the hands
separately would, of itself, lead each individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
to the employment of one more frequently than
the other; but that that one should so universally
be the right hand, seems to be accounted
for only by reference to some natural tendency.
The imitative propensity in man and the convenience
of uniformity of modes of action are scarcely
sufficient to account for it.</p>

<p>I will not detain you by dwelling upon the
effect which the superiority of the right hand
has in giving a slight superiority to the right leg
and the right eye, and will content myself with
mentioning a single beneficial result of the preferential
use of one hand, viz. that by it, we
acquire a greater degree of skilfulness and dexterity
than we should do if both hands were
equally employed. The exclusive use, for instance,
of the right hand in writing, cutting, &amp;c.
gives it a greater expertness than either hand
would have had if both of them had been accustomed
to perform these offices. Hence, we usually
find that persons who are left-handed are rather
clumsy-fingered, because, although, in them, the
left hand is used for many purposes which are
commonly assigned to the right, yet the conventionalities
of life interfere a good deal. The pen
and the knife, for instance, are still wielded by
the right hand. Accordingly such persons are
neither truly right-handed nor truly left-handed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
and they do not commonly acquire so great skill
in the use of either hand as do those whose natural
tendency is more in harmony with custom.</p>

<p class="mt2em">The great martyr of our Church, when at the
stake, is said to have held out his right hand
into the flames and to have been heard exclaiming,
till utterance was stifled, “This unworthy
hand.” This unworthy hand! Of whom or of
what was that hand unworthy? Was it unworthy
of Him who made it? Was it unworthy of him
who bore it? Was it unworthy of the purposes
for which it was made? Was it not, on the
contrary, a too worthy hand? a hand worthy of
a better usage than to be made, first, to sign a
recantation of faith and, then, to be burned for
having done so? a hand worthy of a better man?
No one would have admitted this more readily
than Cranmer. We may be sure that he would
never have thought of proclaiming a hand or any
of his members to be really unworthy of him.
Rather would he have willingly confessed that he
had fallen far short of the standard of excellence
which the body presents; and in that excellence,
we doubt not, he recognised an evidence of Divine
workmanship. His meaning, therefore, has
not been misunderstood. Nevertheless disparaging
remarks respecting the body, and the use of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
word “carnal” in the sense in which it is usually
employed, have some tendency to excuse a shrinking
from moral responsibilities on the ground of
the weakness of the flesh. Let us remember that
much of that weakness is of our own engendering,
that a moral obliquity is the source of many
of those physical infirmities which, we flatter ourselves,
may cover our delinquencies, and which
a sympathising humanity is wont, perhaps too
often, to throw as a shield over offenders against
the laws. In man, and in man alone of created
beings, the physical and the moral grow up together
and react upon one another; and the
charge of a body thus capable of influencing and
being influenced demands all our energies to
prove ourselves worthy of it.</p>

It does not appear that the legend is based upon any
peculiar ideas of susceptibility attached to the heel among Eastern
nations; nor can the passages in Scripture, that the Serpent
shall bruise man’s heel (Genesis iii. 15); “For the greatness of
thine iniquity are thy heels made bare” (Jeremiah xiii. 22), be
adduced as indicating the existence of such an idea. There
are some other myths resembling this one of Achilles; but in
them a different part of the body missed the protecting influence.
Thus, Ajax was wrapped by Hercules in the skin of the Nemæan
lion, and was, thereby, rendered invulnerable, except at the pit
of the stomach where the edges of the skin did not quite meet;
and he killed himself by running his sword in there. In the
<i>Niebelungenlied</i>, the hero, Siegfried, is represented to have rendered
himself invulnerable by smearing himself with the blood
of a dragon which he had killed. A leaf, however, adhering
to his back, prevented the contact of the fluid with one spot.
The secret was unwarily communicated by his wife Krimhild
to his enemy Hagan, who took advantage of the information
to plunge his sword into the fatal spot while Siegfried was stooping
down to drink at a rivulet.</p>

<p>The lesson inculcated by these myths seems to be that all
men, even heroes, have their weak points.</p>

It is a remarkable statement by a correspondent in <i>The
Times</i>, Jan. 14th, 1861, that in the pillage of the Summer Palace
of the Emperor of Pekin “all the ladies of the Court must have
had natural-sized feet, all the slippers found in their rooms being
large; not a single cramped-footed shoe was seen.”</p>

In <span class="smcap">Walking</span> the hind leg moves first, then the fore leg of
the same side; and both reach the ground before the hind leg of
the opposite side is raised. So that at one time there are three
feet on the ground, at another two, but never less than two.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Trotting</span>, especially quick trotting, one foot is raised at
the same instant that the opposite one is put down. This renders
it difficult to make out the sequence of the movements.</p>

further service (Judges i. 6, 7).</p>

In deference to custom we call the palm the <i>front</i> of the
hand; and, therefore, we speak of the thumb as the <i>out</i>er and the
little finger as the <i>in</i>ner digit: though it would better accord
with the ordinary position of the part, with its correspondence
with the foot and with comparative anatomy, to reverse these
terms.</p>

In the tribe of Benjamin “there were seven hundred chosen
men left-handed; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth,
and not miss.” Judges xx. 16. When David was at Ziklag
there came to him a company of men who “were armed with
bows and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling
stones and shooting arrows out of a bow.” 1 Chronicles xii. 2.</p>
